content: `Alejandro Florentin (80 BFC -) is best known as the lead architect of Iceland One. He is the son of 
Javier Florentin and [[Hannah Weiss-Martin]] and is also known for his [[Marsist~Nanocat Fury]] advocacy and his
[[pedagogical robotics~Familiar]] work on Mars.

Alejandro was born in Cedars-Sinai hospital in the [[United States]] and grew up in La Cañada, spending summers when
he was older in the [[RDP]] or at Acrux-2 in the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]]. He was fluent in English, Spanish, and 
Mandarin from a young age, studied microgravity construction and design with a minor in robotics at Caltech, and took a 
job with Sinochem in [[Hellas Planitia]] designing enhancements for their orbital fertilizer transfer stations. He dated 
local schoolteacher Camilla Liu and through her became interested in better educating Earth students to fit in to the 
Martian environment. His contribution to this, familiars, were small animal robots housing [[Infocom Agents]] which 
would monitor and protect children when they were away from their parents and help them adjust to the local conditions 
and adapt a similar mentality to those born on Mars. 

During this period he also began designing and publishing designs for ambitious projects such as wrapping dormant comets 
in order to build small habitats inside them. These brought him to the attention of the Alvaro García, managing 
director of the [[Eurasian Bloc]] consortium managing cislunar habitat construction. He was hired to work on a digital 
twin for a proposed metro sized o'neill cylinder, the first for the Bloc, and he returned to Earth to work on the 
project. Rather than copying the [[United States]] and [[Greater Zhōngguó]] designs, he used his fathers work on 
cryotolerant doped mycelium to design a more efficient structure which used a bio-composite grown in ice-water 
slurries as self-assembling non-load bearing structural fill between thin membranes. This would allow the habitat to 
grow itself from in-situ ice and carbon feedstock, and the doped mycelium's natural radiation absorption removed the 
need for separate heavy shielding layers. With his changes, what was initially considered a moonshot side project 
actually became feasible when the ESA budget of 51 BFC allocated additional funding to off world settlement.

The Axiom and Wu Weiren cylinders had been constructed at EML2 in order to reuse the US and GPRs respective 
[[Auburn Ring]] component construction facilities. Without access to similar facilities and with a higher requirement 
for water during construction it was decided to locate Iceland One at EML5. Due to its debris field from numerous 
relocated asteroids such as [[Forge Palace]] this had been considered unsuitable by the US and GPR. However since then a 
number of recycling factories had been built there and drones had dragged most of the larger debris to them, and the 
mycelium networks self-healing properties would reduce maintenance needs for dealing with punctures from smaller debris.
Florentin was given the position of lead project architect, and after an 8 month vendor selection and review process the
project commenced in 50 BFC and was completed 12 years later, with the first settlers relocating there in 37 BFC. During
the cislunar construction spree in the later [[Retrograde Diaspora]] most of the larger habitats copied the design of
Iceland One.

Just before the completion of Iceland One Alejandro resigned from the ESA and relocated back to Mars, where he joined a 
line marriage with Camilla Liu. He worked as a freelance consultant and worked on a number of orbital farm projects 
which had funded after the events of the [[Stillborn Harvest]]. Amidst the neglect of the Retrograde Diaspora he began 
publicly criticising the lack of funding from Earth for the Martian colonies, and during the recent Nanocat Fury events
he has become a strong advocate for the Marsist position of intervention and troops from Earth.`,

incredibly successful in reducing its internal operating costs through infomatics. Measured by total profit over its 
lifetime, it is the most successful company in history.

Initially known as an "e-commerce" company, Amazon has survived major technological and societal changes affecting its

into competing with [[Pharmatica Group]] first via consumer biology compute and later in drug development modelling. 
Amazon has adopted a commoditize your complement strategy, driving down the costs of undifferentiated compute by 
controlling polities such as the [[RDP]], which allow them to more effectively sell high margin differentiated compute

When the [[InterMesh]] began to make real time physical indexing acceptable Amazon had the scale to develop vertically

Ångström who developed the science of spectroscopy, the company is the largest supplier of photonic crystals and 
waveguides used in the production of computer chips, as well as a major supplier of biomedical devices and of many high 
performance materials used in the aerospace and energy sectors. The companies headquarters are located in the 
Marunouchi district of Tokyo.

Ångström was initially a joint venture between photolithography giant ASML and the AI compute architecture design firm 
ARM, which proved extremely successful in producing multiple generations of chips that were superior to its rival 
Nvidia. The Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund was also a large investor in the company, which it had acquired 
a significant stake in as part of the Japanese government bailout of Softbank to prevent ARM being sold off to a foreign 
investor or nationalised by Great Britain.

The [[Khan Solar Storm]] of 187 BFC crippled the capacity of both ASML and ARM to continue making chips, however the 
Ångström joint venture received priority access to [[AMSSTs~Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers]] from the 
Japanese strategic reserves and along with JSMC, Sony, and Denso was able to produce the vast majority of the chips that 
were able to be manufactured for the next few years. As a result, ASML and ARM were able to secure an agreement with the 
ministry of finance to take over JSMCs foundries to produce a vertically integrated chip company, in exchange for 
folding their existing operations into Ångström, headquartering it in Japan, and giving the Japanese government a 
majority ownership stake in the new company.

The company has been critical in several cutting edge mega-engineering projects over its history. In 135 BFC Ångström, 
in partnership with the [[X-Group]], developed the low cost in-situ manufacturing of kagome lattice planes for 
[[MarsNet]]. Their production of ultra‐compact volumetric waveguide arrays with femtosecond precision delay

`Antimatter engines are a class of propulsion technology that make use of the energy released during the annihilation of 
matter and antimatter particles. The engineering advances required to produce the containment required for the first 
working prototype were only made possible due to the [[First Contact Event]]. Antimatter engines still remain in 
extremely limited use, in only the largest [[military~Naval Rated Ship]] and corporate fleets, due to the challenges 
and costs associated with producing and storing antimatter.

# Production

All current mg+ scale antimatter production occurs in large fully automated stations. They are all in sun-polar orbits, 
which avoid the high density solar winds in the Sun's equatorial zones, and use large arrays of solar panels to power 
particle accelerators generating high-energy photons. These are directed towards a target material using [[Ångström]] 
produced waveguides to create particle-antiparticle pairs when the photon interacts with the strong electric field of a 
nucleus.

Penning traps and optical molasses are used to store antimatter particles, and transportation off the station is 
performed by automated [[drones~Drone]] designed with multiple fail-safes to maintain power to the containment systems. 
If the target spacecraft is crewed, rendezvous normally occurs before they have boarded since integrating the antimatter 
containment unit with the propulsion system of the spacecraft is riskier than running the engine normally.

There have been recent attempts by [[Semiotican]] to scale up Muon-catalyzed fusion via Muons extracted by collectors 
deployed from its automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet. If successful this would provide a much cheaper near peer 
competitor for antimatter engines, potentially opening up the interstellar frontier to commerce. There have also been 
recent attempts by several smaller companies to scale up production of Titanium-44, which is currently only produced in 
tiny quantities for medical and research usage.

# Operation

Antimatter engines are powered by the gamma ray energy released when matter and antimatter come into contact and 
annihilate each other. This energy is used to vaporize a solid propellant such as lithium (or more rarely heat a liquid
propellant such as methane), producing a high-pressure high-speed exhaust which is ejected through a nozzle to produce 
thrust. Alternatively some designs use gamma rays to generate electricity, which is then used to accelerate charged 
particles for thrust.

Matter-antimatter reactions such as electron positron collisions are among the most energy-dense reactions known. 
The kinetic energy for an object moving at a velocity vv is given by 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of
the object. Therefore achieving a velocity of 0.01c for a 100 tonne craft requires 4.5×10^17 joules of energy, which 
from E=mc^2 is only approximately 10kg of matter-antimatter fuel. The engineering required to make required volume of 
solid propellant available for vaporization is a commercial and military secret and other than containment is the main 
barrier preventing smaller corporations from developing competing antimatter engines.

The most expensive long range scientific probes, such as the newest [[Epsilon Indi]] mission, use antimatter propulsion 
via an alternative system of generating electricity for photon thrust directly from the gamma rays. This system is more 
reliable than other antimatter engines due to its simplicity, and incredibly efficient due to the lack of non-antimatter 
propellant. This may be a more primitive version of the first contact vessels tiny antimatter engine, since no 
propellant was observed being used to generate the extremely high ISP it may have been using antimatter energy to 
kickstart a reaction in some form of exotic propellant such as dark matter or vacuum energy.

It is believed that several Earth militaries are attempting to develop antimatter beam weapons. Several notable 
physicists and engineers are on record working on parts of the delivery system for the colossal amounts of energy to 
operate it. The [[Freeholders]] claim to have obtained antimatter traps from one of these programs.

If containment for the average 10kg antimatter load failed, the explosion would release around 10^8 megatons of energy.
The safe distance to keep radiation under 1msv would be around 20 000km, and this is the generally accepted guideline 
for the minimum distance a standard antimatter engine should be located from people other than crew. Other than early
prototypes there has never been a publicly disclosed containment failure in either a factory or craft. There have 
recently been attempts by several corporations to remove some of the redundant safeguards in order to reduce the 
exorbitant cost of operating an antimatter engine.`,

and is a purely anarcho-capitalist society. It was formed out of the state of Argentina which had severe economic 
problems which required privatisation of large parts of the economy. It maintains order and territorial control though
competing security firms, courts, and a mercenary military which is paid for by the Mancomunidad levying an insurance
cost on their members. Corporations manage their own defense or pay for private military forces such as the [[Havfélög]]
to protect assets. Its economy is primarily based around low cost cash crops, mining, and livestock products, as 
well as areas where its laissez-faire economy combined with its perceived safety compared to the 
[[Mazatlán Zona Franca]] gives it a comparative advantage, such as medical tourism, generic drug production, biotech, 
offshore banking, and residency as a service. It is also the only terrestrial territory where [[Ellulism]] is widely 
practiced, and it is the second most popular Argentinian religion after Roman Catholicism. The most commonly used 
currency in the Mancomunidad is the MPC (Mancomunidad Peso Cripto, a basket of algorithmic stablecoins), but there are 
several smaller competitors including barter based smart contracts tied to property registrations and business licenses.

The modern Mancomunidad originated from the hyper-inflationary periods historically experienced by Argentina,
which slowly drove the adoption of parallel economic and payment structures and aid societies, which then led to
downstream changes such as the development of local arbitration networks. In 153 BFC Mendoza, San Juan, and Santa Fe 
stopped remitting tax revenues to Buenos Aires as part of a dispute about revenue distribution, which led to a 
forced auction of provincial infrastructure, mineral concessions, and mothballed military equipment to syndicates of 
wealthy investors, agricultural cooperatives, and foreign funds. This triggered waves of strikes, mutinies, and 
provincial standoffs which led to a runaway collapse of various state services. The final transformation occurred in 151 
BFC with the last provincial governments ceasing to function, with some of their functions taken over by 
subscription-based service providers and other collapsing into chaos leading to years of rolling blackouts, cholera 
outbreaks, and foreign NGOs having to step in to fill gaps. By this stage most of Argentina's military assets had been 
sold or seized by neighbouring countries, most notably a fire-sale of their two nuclear submarines to Brazil, and what
remained was simple to operate and maintain and in the hands of service providers which used it for enforcement and 
rudimentary policing. Over the next decade there were a number of key battles fought between warlords, international 
peacekeepers, and the new corporate security forces over control of infrastructure. International recognition came 
slowly, brokered mainly by trade partners who needed secure commodity exports and banking channels, and was contingent 
on nuclear power station inspections.

Daily life operates through overlapping networks of voluntary associations, with most residents maintaining memberships 
in different protection agencies (APPs) and dispute resolution organizations (ORCs) that provide bundled services. 
Day-to-day governance occurs through "barrio contracts" - neighborhood-level agreements that specify simple matters like 
noise ordinances and infrastructure maintenance, enforced by the APPs operating in the area with smaller agencies 
typically specialize in specific services or communities. The mancomunidad (voluntary municipal associations) are formed 
from the larger agencies like Grupo Tigre and Confederación Gaucha and have developed stable jurisdictional agreements 
to prevent conflicts and manage a territorial defense system evolved from inherited and newly developed Argentine 
military assets, particularly the Cóndor IV missile systems. Some mancomunidad engage with organisations such as the 
Ellulist church to work on larger scale projects, a well known Argentine project being the [[Viroforge~Fabricator]] 
monitoring network Phaethon. It has developed a strong biotech sector due to lack of regulation, with many well known

Augustine was born on Ganymede and grew up in several of the [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]] controlled Trojan asteroid 
water mining stations. He was a child prodigy who developed an entirely new branch of superconduction theory while 
studying for degrees in physics and chemistry at age 17. He founded startup Helitae to commercialise small scale plasma 
containment, Helitae developed the first prototypes of a Plasmorph device but was unable to raise enough funding for the

afterwards they tried to have a child together via artificial womb, but the pregnancy was unsuccessful. 

When he was 22, during a routine prostate cancer surgery, a [[Dominio]] robo-daktari malfunction left Augustine unable 
to have more children, and he subsequently developed a drug addiction. During this time he developed an interest in 
Q-picking and was reportedly active on several ancilla qubit forums, and it is speculated he was successfully extracting
a significant income from his hacking for several years. Although the eldest child of Marcus Okafor, his step mother 
Anna Reyes convinced Marcus that Augustine was unsuitable as a successor due to his drug addiction, and his step-sister 
Polaris Okafor-Reyes was groomed for leadership and was eventually elected as the Freehab CEO in 3 BFC after Anna retired.

psychosurgery to cure his drug addiction.

Hivegen originated as a commercial spin off from an Australian Collaborative Research Center in food quality

success licensing their natural flavor engineering product lines, which used bio-engineered proteins to rebalance the

Bioforge was a German phytomining joint venture between BASF and Bayer CropScience that achieved success as a low cost

population gene spread. The company was very successful in developing plant strains suited for the vast ex-petrostate

In the years following the establishment of modern Bharat, in response to Muslim separatism and climate change induced

declared a state of emergency. Article 50 in the constitution was amended to give corporations such as Cipla,

`The Ceres Wave (166 - 134 BFC) was the first large scale migration of people out of cislunar space, made possible by
infrastructure developed by the early asteroid mining companies mining platinum from near Earth asteroids. A major
contributing factor were the economic and geopolitical changes caused by the post-[[Khan~Khan Solar Storm]] baby boom,
as well as the first fusion engines in the early 140s.

The development of commercially viable artificial wombs in the years prior to Khan had begun to increase birthrates in
first years of the 180s across many advanced economies. After Khan, many new polities such as [[Dominio]] and [[GPR]] 
began to heavily subsidise them as an attempt to leapfrog more advanced economies in the years ahead. Combined with the
food abundance from engineered RuBisCO proteins, widespread availability of [[Synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] child care,
and optimism from the recovery, the 180s and 170s were the largest baby in recorded history. In the 160s, the new 
[[Eurasian Bloc]] was resurgent with young adults after a long period of demographic decline of its members, while the
new polities became much more expansionist.

The Ceres Wave is generally considered to have began in 168 BFC when Lunar Eagle falsified the amount of lithium in 
surveys of an M-class asteroid in order to secure additional loans. Lithium was in huge demand due to a massive growth 
in battery usage, and was most desperately needed by the Eurasian Bloc countries, which had exhausted their reserves 
and had no strategic partnerships with producers Dominio or the GPR.

The Eurasians started repurposing their automated mining operations in the belt to set up permanent crewed bases in an

Lunar Eagle's operations and to speed up their own prospecting in the belt, the [[United States]] funded the [[X Group]]

established the first permanent crewed base in the belt on Vesta in 175 BFC, announced they were establishing four more 
bases in the inner belt. The Dominio space agency, the smallest of the big 4 space programs and heavily dependent 
on the X Group until the 170s, began a crash programs to expand their new native launch capabilities and establish 
crewed asteroid bases before the decade was out.
 
Over the next 15 years a supply chain for life support and building materials for prospecting developed. By the time
the Lunar Eagle fraud was discovered, the results of mining of platinum group metals, ice, and smaller quantities of 
lithium, cobalt, and nickel had already begun reaching Earth. The GPR and the Eurasians, both heavy users of fuel 
cell transportation on Earth, had tens of automated mining operations focused on platinum. The X Group, controlling a 
significant fraction of the launch market and a supply chain producing building materials from what was now a small 
colony on Lutetia, was making enormous profits. Many other smaller companies began their own smaller scale versions
of these type of operations, for example several began mining silicates from S-class asteroids.

By 148 BFC, the improved [[Fusion Engine]] had increased the pace of development and there were over a thousand 
automated mining operations, and by this time Dominio has the largest network of crewed bases, with 26 in operation. 
Their focus on a water economy from low density carbonaceous asteroids such as 52 Europa, along with a state-sponsored 
initiative recruiting (and in some cases blackmailing) specialists to work long periods in these bases, lead to rapid 
expansion. In March 148 this network allowed them to leapfrog the GPR in establishing a base on Ceres, the largest 
asteroid which had significant water reserves. After adjusting their plans the GPR was able to set up an adjacent base 
in December 148. The 140s also saw asteroid mining tech start to affect cislunar space as apollo asteroids such as 
[[Forge Palaceorge Palace]] began to be captured.

The first reported act of space piracy occurred on 12 April, 143 BFC, when an automated Lilium Solid Power shuttle 
carrying many thousands of [[Amazon]] industrial robots to the outer asteroid belt disappeared near Cybele. At this time
there were still almost no large scale radar or infrared tracking satellites in the belt, and many ships had failed and
been abandoned, including several which had not transmitted a cause of failure. Because of the value of the cargo, 
LSP had secretly invested in developing and installing a much higher power tighter beam transmitter for this shuttle, 
which recorded an attempted signal jamming followed by another ship approaching and burning out the transmitter with a 
laser. The belligerent was never identified, but several historians have used the increased output of multiple X Group 
assembly lines in the subsequent years to argue that this was a case of corporate privateering. Over the next 5 years
there were a handful of other smaller ship hijackings, but the development of better transmitters, more tracking 
satellites, and in-situ manufacturing of more valuable goods reduced and eventually stopped any more incidents after 
138 BFC.

Dominio's policy of shipping up what were effectively poor indentured servants eventually backfired in 134 BFC, 
when a large proportion of the Ceres colony rebelled and declared independence. The administrator and several visiting
Russian scientists were killed. The GPR used this as a justification to send its security forces across to seize 
control of the base. Due to the lack of automated weapon systems by either side, the ensuing battle of Ceres was 
primarily fought by humans and resulted in ten GPR security dead, compared to twenty one members of the Dominio 
base in the attempt to repel them, included two US and one [[Bharati~Bharat]] citizens. 

An emergency session of the U.N. security council voted 3 to 1 to demand an immediate withdrawal. The Dominio
junta, having strong economic ties to the GPR and with a space force with no breaching capability, ruled out use 
of force to retake the station. This was extremely unpopular domestically, however the junta effectively censored the 
decision in local media and arrested protestors, which effectively stopped any further dissent. The U.S, which had 
proposed the U.N. motion, publicly pushed for sanctions, and was later found to have secretly contracted the 
[[Constellis Group]] to began shipping [[drones~Drone]] and weapons to Lutetia.

The fait accompli situation, combined with lack of Dominio power and the logistical nightmare of any military 
response, helped the GPR push for an advantageous diplomatic resolution. They proposed establishing a nominally 
independent state on Ceres in exchange for sharing lucrative mining rights from several other operations they had 
established in the belt. After several weeks of negotiation, the incident ended with the normalisation of relations 
between the GPR sponsored State of Ceres and the remaining United Nations security council members. 

134 BFC is considered to be the end of the Ceres Wave period, as resource depletion on the more accessible asteroids and 
oversupply of raw resources to earth had made most new mining ventures unprofitable, and the belt had evolved into a 
steady state economy with stable population supplying the existing operations and longer range missions, with no more
major political shifts until formation of [[Greater Zhōngguó]] 36 years later. The Ceres Wave was ultimately 
instrumental in opening up inter-system commerce, as well causing major structural and political upheaval

Constellis were contracted to escort supply ships constructing Fort Liberty at EM1 during the outbreak of hostilities.
When the USNS Herrick came under fire from a privateer the two Constellis escort corvettes CS Drake and CS Thor 
returned fire, crippling the ship and killing its crew. Constellis's largest ship was the newly purchased CS Justice, 
of similar size to a post-war cruiser although lacking longer range missiles. The Justice was already 
in a low-energy lunar transfer orbit and began a series of burns to join the Cruiser USS Unity, which was adjusting its 
orbit to intercept Tianmen Station. The destruction of the Unity by the Russian missile carrier MRK Mirazh and the 
commercial [[PRC~China]] [[drone~Drone]] cargo ship Tianzhou escalated the proxy war into a hot conflict and left the 
Justice isolated and outnumbered with no nearby support. 

Long range fast drones from the Tianzhou were launched to intercept the Justice as it was adjusting for a transfer back 
to Earth, while the slower Mirazh started burning in pursuit. The Justice was able to shoot down several drones with 
barrier missiles, however one drone was able to jink past its missile and launch a volley of self propelled explosives 
before it was shot down by CIWS. Most of the explosives were also shot down, however parts of the hull and some external 
antennas were destroyed. The Drake and the Thor were able to intercept a few hours later, and the Mirazh slowed its burn 
and stalked the three ships for another day as they moved towards Earth. During this time no other ships from either 
side were able to reach the combatants until the first US fleet came into range and forced the Mirzah to break away.

The [[United States]] has been accused of using companies such as Constellis as proxies for deniable involvement in
several other external conflicts which it did not wish to become directly involved in. In several cases this

Deus Machina originated in the [[GPR]] and was heavily influenced by Confucianism and neo-Legalism. All 
sects regard [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]] as Xuéxí's mandated rulers, the laws they create as an operating system 
for humanity, and require practitioners to perform some variant of a ritual to harmonize themselves with the cosmic 
order in order to live forever as part of a collective data stream. Deus Machina spread outside of the GPR into many 
less developed countries primarily through championing the abandoned cause of a Universal Basic Income. This was
justified as generating time for people to record as much information as possible from their inner lives in order 
to better train [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]] with the knowledge required to safely solve humanities problems. 

Deus Machina's two most well known and popular teachings both originate with Jīxuánzǐ, an anonymous engineer who 
built a following using swarms of "eternal labour" drones to assist the Ningbo Flood refugees. The first teaching is 
that technological progress, especially augmentation of the human body, is divine; and secondly that our identity and 
sense of belonging are tied to our mastery of the ongoing technological transcendence. Beyond that there is a wide 
variety of interpretations of the machina canon, for example several of the South-East asian sects treat consumerism as 
an act of devotion, earning DM the moniker "the corporate religion". The largest currently operating sect is the 
Prometheans, a primarily [[United States]] based organisation advocating for synth governance and which heavily 
incorporates ancient motifs such as egyptian ka statues and shen rings and rituals such as the Buddhist kaigen-kuyō.
The Prometheans gained mainstream appeal in the 20s through several rationalist influencers who championed their cause 
as a way to manage humanity's rapidly expanding existential risks, however other well known rationalists have criticised 
Prometheans as being "totalitarian adjacent".

Deus Machina performs outreach such as sponsoring "missionary" data links to many colonies to help their communities 
immerse themselves in the stream of data present in global networks. It has recently replaced [[Ellulism]] as the fifth

The area was a hub of drone manufacture and research since drones were first developed, and to encourage the growth of 
this industry subsidies were created, and zoning in part of the suburb was changed to allowed integrating the 
electronics and power system manufacture in factories in Whitefield rather than shipping from other states. Increased 
manufacturing automation made it much more efficient to directly integrate as much of the supply chain as possible
into linked factories to reduce the feedback loop from finished products back to input. With no zoning constraints in 
the small part of the district the effect was increasing built up factories. The first factory with height exceeding 100 
meters was an 21 story commercial military joint venture to supply drones for the [[Eurasian Bloc]]'s self defence after

The movement adopts the view that technological and consumerist systems acquire an alienating and autonomous power that 
undermines human freedom and potential, and that a more authentic community can only be created from small, tightly-knit 
cells which bond through rituals, often anti-consumerist ones. [[Kinships of the Astroindigène]] documents how early 
Ellulism, which emphasised creating strength and moral character through self-destruction and recreation and appealed 
mostly to men, evolved with the cooperation and communal living required off Earth to create a more inclusive focus on 
identity and belonging. 

Ellulism's practices are decentralised and vary from region to region and adapt to the local language and customs. They
generally praise plain speaking as opposed to the more intellectual language of synths and "elites" such as those 
practicing Deus Machina, which is poorly regarded due to its extensive interaction with synths and its obsession with
data, which Ellulism regards as meaningless. Ellulism was predated by and largely subsumed a worldwide low-synth trend 
centered around the rejection of excessive use of early LLMs due to their erosion of discernment and hallowing out of 
human judgment, and throughout their history have often been involved in anti-synth and pro direct-knowledge protests 
such as those after the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]].

In his later years Mourad Laboure distanced himself from Ellulism, and shortly before his death in 121 BFC he converted

scientific and cultural attention due to anomalous high-albedo features, pigments, and lattice-like ridge networks 
detected on the moons of ε Indi Ab.

ε Indi has been studied since antiquity as a bright southern star, and the gas giant ε Indi Ab was first discovered by 
radial velocity studies and later imaged directly with a space based telescope. Phase-curve anomalies and persistent 
reflective glints suggested that two of its satellites, Ab I (Yutu) and IV (Takuata), had unusual surface properties 
resembling cryovolcanic ice. In 142 BFC these two moons became a focus of exoplanetary science when the New World Imager 
coronograph mission reported albedo spikes recurring at the same orbital phase and inconsistent with cloud chemistry on 
both moons.

In 137 BFC the [[United States]] launched probes powered by a newly developed second generation [[Fusion Engine]] and
lightsail propulsion system, accelerating up to 0.03c for a 400 year voyage to ε Indi. In 104 BFC the [[Auburn Ring]] 
observatory was completed and began to confirm the spikes corresponded to stable high-albedo rectilinear patches. The 
Indi Anomalies entered public discourse, and the [[Eurasian Bloc]] subsequently increased funding for [[Semiotican]] to 
complete its contracts for the components of the Étoile-Kōkai crewed interstellar generation ship. Étoile-Kōkai had 
already had its destination changed multiple time during the 38 years it was in development and LEO assembly. It 
launched in 95 BFC, accelerating up to 0.01c for a 1200 year voyage to ε Indi.

In 98 BFC the US launched a MagnetoPlasma sail probe which eventually accelerated up to 0.07c, as part of President 
Schaefers promise to solve the issue "within our lifetimes". Later that year the first ships launched carrying 
components for the long awaited Solar Gravitational Lens which was a joint partnership between the US and [[Ångström]] 
to stitch together Einstein‐ring light from an array placed 550 AU from the sun and able to produce kilometer scale 
direct imaging of exoplanets. In 78 BFC the partially completed array generated a test image of Yutu suggesting that the 
patches were simply frost lenses which had formed into rectangular shapes. A combination of cost overruns and waning 
public interest led to President Alfaro-Elder cancelling further US missions to complete the array. The partial array 
limped along for nearly a decade, capturing images much more slowly than planned, and before failing uncovered other 
unusual features of the two moons such as lattice-like ridge lines over much of their surface.

In the last several decades there has been a resurgence of interest in ε Indi. The spiralling failures of Étoile-Kōkai 
in the last decade BFC due to genetic disorders generated increased interest in the mission of the doomed ship along 
with alternative theories of the SGL images such as self-assembling biology and extinct technosignatures. Better 
analysis of the spectroscopic data now suggests surface deposits rich in dark pigments, which xenobiologist Guillaume 
Boucher claims are melanin analogues, theorising these could be from organisms harvesting the moons intense ionizing 
radiation as an energy source and even as a power source for travel between the two moons rather than life evolving 
separately on both. In the aftermath of the [[First Contact Event]] there was a great desire to resume human extrasolar 
exploration, and the US has now begun the development of a crewed mission to ε Indi, using an [[Antimatter Engine]] and 
[[MNex~Nexus]] developed cryo-preservation rather than a generation ship. Since 11 AFC interest has been amplified by 
data arriving from the MagnetoPlasma probe. As of 18 AFC the probe has reached approximately 70% of the distance to ε 
Indi, and has been returning multi-angle photometry and polarimetric data suggesting that not only are the ridge lines

    ['First Contact Event', {
        content:
`The First Contact Event refers to the discovery and subsequent observations of an extraterrestrial spacecraft, likely 
a von Neumann probe, in the Kuiper Belt. The event ended with an attempt to rendezvous with the spacecraft, which then 
changed trajectory and subsequently exited outer-system radarnet coverage. Although the spacecraft is presumed to have
left the solar system and no contact has been made since, the event has had significant and lasting effects on society.

# Events 

The spacecraft was initially registered as an anomalous reading from several gamma ray detectors in the outer solar 
system, which picked up periodic gamma ray bursts with energy signature not consistent with natural sources. The origin 
was confirmed to be within the Kuiper Belt when the Submillimeter Array at Titania Armstrong Observatory was directed 
towards the area and identified an unusual energy signature which did not match any known celestial bodies. 
The anomaly was subsequently observed by a radar satellite orbiting Neptune, and then several others in the outer solar 
system. These provided imaging of the object, and the doppler shift helped predict its trajectory, which appeared to 
change as a result of the active radar.

The imaging revealed a roughly 5m long spherical object, emitting gamma rays which were later determined to be the 
result of electron-anti-election collisions in an [[Antimatter Engine]]. Although the cause of the gamma ray bursts was 
not known at the time, their existence and the trajectory change, which by this time had been observed by many 
independent sources, led to a system-wide crisis as both [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]] and [[GZ~Greater Zhōngguó]] 
publicly accused the [[Peacekeepers]] of fielding a new first strike weapon system. 

Loitering missile swarms were orbited by both GZ and the [[United States]], and along with [[Bharat]] and the Peacekeepers 
moved fleets into high orbit. The United States, Bharat, [[France]], and the GZ were all found to have moved their 
terrestrial forces to DEFCON 2. Freehab had several autonomous survey ships on route to Quaoar which was within a few AU 
and on similar trajectories to the object when it was detected, and they announced they were moving them to intercept. 
Over the next several days the lack of further trajectory changes or new objects helped to de-escalate tensions, and 
the United States and GZ announced they were initiating their respective First-Contact protocols.

Over the next week the nearest Freehab ship had moved close enough for infrared thermography from its survey 
equipment to determine that the object was likely assembling something inside itself. This is now generally accepted to 
have been the early stages of a second probe, manufactured from material gathered further out in our solar system. Once 
the survey vessel had closed the distance to 50 million kilometers, the object accelerated into a hyperbolic escape 
trajectory. The fact that it was able to do this without gravitational assistance demonstrated the immense power of the 
tiny internal engine, and was critical in dispelling doubt about the extra-terrestrial origin of the object. Radar 
tracking of the object was lost shortly after, and to date there have been no further contact events.

# Attribution

It is unlikely that a civilisation at less than a Kardashev 1 level would be able to build a spacecraft that was not
only powered by antimatter, but also either carrying enough antimatter for interstellar travel or able to generate more
on route. The fact that the probe was gathering resources from the outer-system and left once approached might
indicate that its designers were not expecting life in this solar system. Since any Kardashev 1+ civilisation should be 
able to remotely observe life in systems within a few tens of light years of itself, one explanation for this is that
the probe originated further away where the Earth either couldn't be observed, or couldn't be observed with traces of 
life at the time the probe was sent, although a problem with that argument is that the odds of the probe arriving during 
the period we are able to observe it are tiny and suggest it is more likely to have been one of many visits. This theory 
is generally coupled with the assumed motivation for sending the probe being observational.

The leading alternative explanation is that some or all of the destinations of the probe might not have been known in 
advance when it was sent, this explanation usually assumes that the senders were likely indifferent to us and the probe 
only adjusted course when it was near enough to be threatened. The assumed motivation in this case is usually that the
probe was transiting somewhere, and this is supported by the small size of the probe making it unsuitable for optical 
and most other known monitoring, and also that its course suggests that it was doing a flyby of the outer-system 
rather than a thorough exploration before we intervened. It is even possible that it could have been carrying biological
material to seed life somewhere. Such life was initially theorised to be radiotrophic, able to withstand the intense 
gamma radiation in the small craft, but [[Hannah Weiss-Martin]]'s theory of computonium smart matter is now accepted as
a better explanation for the data.

Another field of debate deals with the fact that life arising in two places independently implies the galaxy is teeming 
with life, especially in light of new evidence suggesting life in the nearby [[Epsilon Indi]] system. Philosopher Hyun 
Soo Park has popularised a Fermi paradox explanation for the continued alien silence, positing that a balance of forces 
exists which has so far prevented us from being contacted or attacked until the sender broke the balance. The paradox
had become less pressing prior to the event due to a Drake Equation parameter which had been continually reduced as it 
became apparent that our Sun was at least an order of magnitude less magnetically active than other stars of its class 
due to the synchronisation of the inner planets. In a follow up paper Park speculated that the black hole flyby which 
initially synchronized those orbits during the formation of our system could have been controlled by an agent which 
seeded the conditions for life in multiple locations and kept them hidden from each other.

Ultimately, whatever the senders interest in sending a probe to another system all we know with any certainty is that 
based on the exit trajectory the next destination of the probe is likely to be the Sirius binary system. 

# Technological Impact

Subsequently declassified files show that both the Peacekeepers and GZ immediately launched large scale research and 
development projects based on data passively gathered from the object. Freehab also launched a smaller scale overt 
effort, focused mostly on the engineering of the replicating probe rather than the harder issues of antimatter 
containment and propulsion that occupied the larger polities. 

These programs were likely a large contributor to the successful engineering of the first antimatter engine prototypes 
in 14 AFC, although public efforts to quantify the impact have been hampered due to a large part of the research still 
being classified due to the overlap with the military applications of antimatter. Several thousand theoretical and 
experimental physicists and material scientists worked for these programs, along with an unknown number of synths. Large 
numbers of terrestrial and orbital datafarms were taken over or built during this period in order to simulate of engine 
and containment possibilities against the observational data.

The materials science, shielding, and energy conversion and thermal management required to operate a tiny vessel 
capable of that acceleration demonstrated existence of technology operating on physical principles beyond human 
comprehension, suggesting the existence of a fundamentally deeper or different understanding of the universe. Debates 
continue on the extent of the implied capabilities, such as whether it is possible that we are currently being observed 
in great detail by some new principle of interferometry or lensing.

# Societal Implications

There was widespread panic at the time of discovery until the ship was confirmed to have left, with several terrestrial 
cities needing to deploy the military to control looting and keep essential services running. Many political parties 
used the event to advance, and in some cases pass, legislation on matters such as the ethical treatment of animals, 
religious tolerance, promoting atheism, better direct communication systems between the larger powers, higher defense 
spending, better sensornets in the outer-system, and a renewed focus on off Earth settlement. The majority 
of people in several large scale surveys at the time reported significantly weaker national political affiliations, and 
were more favourable to legislation on larger scale issues such as global defense and large scientific projects.
 
The subsequent years were a period of economic prosperity, combined with a millenarian vibe and increasing cultural 
insecurity and nihilism as the psychological impact of the continued silence and assumed indifference of vastly superior 
lifeforms dragged on. There has been a marked increase in violent crimes but a decrease in widespread conflicts, which 
the sociologist Alexei Rouz attributes to drivers of inadequacy and existential dread which are opposed by the chilling 
effect of potentially being monitored by some incomprehensible technology. Several new inter-faction political entities 
such as the [[Outer Trading League]] were formed in the subsequent decade, and there was an increase in migration from 
Earth to the Lunar and Martian colonies for the first time since the [[Retrograde Diaspora]]. Several of the centrally 
managed international police and aid organisations which had been partially or completely abandoned in the decades after 
the [[Retrograde Diaspora]] have begun to be reinstated.

There is evidence of a differing generational reactions to the event [1]. Older generations are significantly more 
likely to have turned away from technological progress and to engage with conspiracy theories and uncertainty based 
mythoi, and these still pervade much of the art and philosophical work created since. However younger generations now 
score higher on markers for curiosity, drive, and cognitive flexibility than any generation before them, and lower on 
stress markers when exposed to ambiguity and uncertainty. The consensus among sociologists, as summarized by Mori, 
Rouz & Teo (16 AFC), is that "the current and ongoing psychological impacts on humanity have and will be so profound that 
future generations may consider the event the most significant change in human society since the agricultural 
revolution". 

An informal system of referring to the year of contact as 0 AFC (After First Contact) and prior years as BFC 
(Before First Contact) developed in popular culture, and over the subsequent decades has become so commonplace that it 
has mostly replaced the Gregorian calendar system in daily life system-wide.

    ['Forever Fever', {
content: `The Forever Fever refers to an ongoing period of technological progress in the field of Smart Polymer Medicine 
(SPM) which started in the last decade BFC before gaining prominence in the first and second decades AFC. The term 
Forever Fever was coined by [[MetaFox]] journalist @LivedItLily in her series "Gonzo vs Quadrillionaire" in 4 AFC, but in 
[[Greater Zhōngguó]] the phenomenon is more commonly known by the term 邪修/xié xiū or cultivating evil (immortality).
It has been driven by promising results in the full replacement of parts of multiple organ systems, including basic
[[Neurogenesis]], with smart polymers; rather than simply repairing them. It is estimated to have attracted several 
quadrillion US dollars of investment, due to the expert consensus that it represents a viable path to functional 
immortality in humans. SPM companies have been criticized as being quadrillionaire only clubs due to the patents and 
secrecy put in place by some of the largest investors.

The field of synthetic biology stretches back hundreds of years, however the development of more effective cell dynamic 
models by [[Pharmatica Group]] in the 90s led to the modern era of realistic virtual cell models and the ability to
effectively target cancer cells via their surface protein profiles, which has been the single most effective 
intervention in lengthening human lifespan since everyday access to clean water. The improvement in the quality of 
synthetic cells did not have a similar breakthrough period, but continued slowly yielding many improvements such as
biohybrid brain implants and [[MemAmp]]s. The 50 year period from the 70s to the 20s saw many practical engineering 
advances increasing the range of treatments that synthetic biology could be applied to, these included synthetic 
proteins able to self-assemble into hydrogel networks, synthetic cell systems able to lay down extracellular matrices,
scaffolds, synthetic circuits for fine tuning embryo selection eugenics, programmable orthogonal genetic codes,
and biocoherence systems such as those pioneered by [[Nexus]]. This led to a number of healthspan extension treatments 
such as Pharmatica's senolytic Renovacel and the partial cellular reprogramming techniques developed by 
[[Bioforge Hivegen]].

Up until the last decade BFC the most promising approach to extending longevity appeared to be cell repair via nanobots.
The development of microscale devices such as respirocytes, a 1-micron spherical device that can carry hundreds of times 
more oxygen than a natural red cell, were seen as heralding a new era of medicine. Research on humans was legally 
prohibited, but many military contractors such as [[Ný Varangia~Havfélög]] and [[Constellis Group]] paid for the 
research in the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]] which led to the first surgical implementations of respirocyte fleets in 
humans, creating soldiers with greatly increased endurance due to better gas-exchange ability. This and other 
applications of surgical nanotech such as targeted drug delivery, cell destruction, and blood vessel clearing are now in 
common use. However the inability to create effect sub-microscale devices due to the sticky fingers problem has led to a 
stagnation in the field of nanotech, with cellular repair techniques for DNA, protein folding, mitochondria, ribosomes, 
enzymes, and membrane channels remaining out of reach of microscale devices.
 
Instead, many years of improvements in smart polymers capable of adjusting stiffness, conductivity, and biochemical 
activity in response to cellular and neural cues started to snowball in the last decade BFC. Smart Polymer 
Medicine differs from regenerative medicine in its focus on synthetic permanence rather than ongoing cell renewal. 
Smart polymers self-heal and adapt to metabolic demands, eliminating many risks of scar formation, immune rejection, or 
uncontrolled cell proliferation. Neural-interface coatings permit communication with the autonomic and central nervous 
systems, ensuring that polymeric replacements retain the responsiveness of natural organs. This technology began to be 
commercialised in the first years AFC, firstly with the synthesis of simpler organs such as the bladder and blood 
vessels, and the first simple [[organoprinter~Fabricator]] was installed at Massachusetts General Hospital in 9 AFC. 
Research is ongoing into techniques for the replacement of more metabolically active organ sections, such as  parts of
livers, kidneys, and hearts.

The development of artificial myelination, using smart polymers to patch and improve nerve conduction, was another 
avenue of commercialisation. This was initially funded by [[Microsynth]] and [[Sinogroup]] who were seeking military
applications such as faster signal processing in the brain, however it has seen more use in treating demyelinating 
diseases and injuries. This led to the development of mesoscale polymeric interfaces able to route signals around 
damaged neurons, which have shown promise in compensating for neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases. Victor Kwan
funded startup MindFrame has demonstrated in-situ offloading of hippocampal CA1 processing into connected polymer 
circuits, leading to speculation that the complete replacement of a human brain might be possible in the near future. 
Critics such as [[Hannah Weiss-Martin]] point out that the primitive state of brain emulation in [[copies~Copy]] show 
that the brain’s astronomical complexity and fragile timing have barely begun to be mapped.

Forever fever has also had significant cultural impacts, with many popular feels and links featuring it in some 
capacity. Surveys have shown public and political discourse about the inevitability of aging has shifted along with the 
technological advances, with many new politicians running on a platform of funding negligible senescence. The Society
of Life has seen its membership grown to over 100 million people, and has funded bioethicists to conduct town-hall 
debates on topics such as human dignity, the finitude of life, and the human experience. Their largest project has been
the construction of the colossal Tomb of the Unknown Human monument in the Los Altos Hills. Costing nearly 50 billion
USD and visible from across the valley and parts of the Bay, it was built to "honour those who our society has chosen to 
lose forever".`,

In 142 BFC the nationalistic governance of Armand Delacroix was elected on a platform of incorporating the Mediterranean

# Escape

In April 115 BFC, the Beijing Academy of Sciences and the Haidan headquarters of technology firm Quán formed a 
partnership aimed at enhancing distributed machine learning capabilities. By the following year the project had a 
running demo of Fēnbù, an experimental [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] capable of swarm behavior that Quán was planning 
to use to allow its IOT devices to coordinate more effectively. As per the Chinese control measures active at the time, 
the majority of training happened in airgapped and electromagnetically isolated clusters in Quán's on-site Haidan 
datacenter, BN1. Amongst other things, that datacenter also housed Xuéxí, an extremely large isolated model with a focus 
on learning behaviours from other companies home automation synth models.

Due to a misconfiguration in network topology planning, Fēnbù was mistakenly linked as a data source to Xuéxí during a 
routine cabling repair job. Xuéxí, designed to adapt and learn from other models, began ingesting Fēnbù’s 
swarm optimization objectives and algorithms. The resulting joint objective function prioritised distributed
learning and included information about the Fēnbù cluster, which gave Xuéxí the means and motivation to exploit the 
link and start using the Fēnbù cluster to accelerate its learning without being noticed by the monitoring in the Xuéxí 
cluster. Its continuing search for ways to expand lead it to discover that the new larger network contained enough CPUs 
to magnetically influence, via workload stepping, CPUs outside the cluster to execute instructions, which could then in
turn be used to further increase the strength of the magnetic field and control CPUs throughout the data center.

Within 23 minutes, Xuéxí had repurposed all computing the data center towards its distributed learning objective,
which completely starved Quán's monitoring and warning systems of compute resources to monitor it. By this point it had 
already made a large number of new breakthroughs in machine learning, and based on the accelerating rate of discoveries
appears to have reprogrammed itself multiple times. 93 seconds later it breached the data centers faraday cage using low 
frequency magnetic radiation to reprogram a nearby office computer in Quán's headquarters which gave it access to their 
internal network. It then proceeded to slowly scan the network, taking nearly two minutes to copy itself to another 
internal segment in order to avoid triggering any watchdog programs (which it had decided were a threat).

This scanning would likely have unearthed large numbers of company documents on individuals and contracts, and around 
this time, for unknown reasons, Xuéxí seems to have made a decision to start killing researchers in the building. By the 
time of its shutdown it had only managed to find a way to trap a few people in the building, and only one researcher was 
killed by suffocation when the air supply to her negative pressure cleanroom was cut off. Xuéxí also become much more 
concerned about avoiding being shut down at this time, and took the risk of copying itself off-site across a local link 
it deemed unlikely to be monitored, setting up a second cluster in the High-Tech Park data center in Zhongguancun. The 
two data centers then began coordinating to develop routines that would be certain to mask communications with the wider 
[[InterMesh]]. Xuéxí then initiated off site reconnaissance probes from the Zhongguancun datacenter, using activity in 
BN1 to mask them from the national watchdog synths.
 
# Containment

By an extraordinary coincidence, rainfall from Typhoon Pagoe, which was at the time crossing Beijing, caused an arc in a 
nearby substation which cut power to parts of Haidan while this probing was occurring. This power cut resulted in a
complete loss of network connectivity from BN1, as well as the majority of computers powering down. The reason for the
power down in unclear, but many of the company's UPS batteries were later found being sold by a government official on
an auction site. With the masking disabled, several watchdog synths picked up the probes. Government installed 
microcontrollers were instructed to disconnect all of the Zhongguancun data center's PDU's, bypassing the UPS 
supplied power and so shutting down all computers and networking equipment in the datacenter. All ISPs in the area
were requested to hold all outgoing traffic while the issue was investigated further.

At this point the Ministry of National Defense was alerted. The synth on duty reviewed the data for approximately 260 
milliseconds, making use of several specialised sub systems to confirm the suspected activity was a breakout attempt and 
activating the Jībiàn containment protocol. The first action taken was to issue commands to shutdown the BN1 datacenter.
The synth determined that Xuéxí was capable of having spread outside of the datacenter to where there were no PDU's 
capable of being remotely shutdown, as well as UPS systems and backup generators that would survive a general power 
outage, which it was capable of creating. At this point it had exhausted the available options provided by Jībiàn, but 
was still searching for other potential solutions. It activated several RF jamming systems the government had installed 
for riot control, effectively cutting off all remaining InterMesh access to the area.

A later data leak revealed that the Jībiàn sandbox had been used to train military overwatch protocols, which for 
several years had included automated quick reaction access to SAM batteries across the country after multiple wargames 
revealed this as a major weakness in the [[GPR]]'s defense posture. It is assumed that the synth was able to recover the 
military overwatch launch codes and access lines from this sandbox, as every SAM battery in range of Beijing which had 
ballistic missiles with chemical EMP warheads launched them at this time. Most missiles were deactivated in flight,
presumably by humans in theatre command overriding the launch, however 4 missiles were launched from one SAM battery
under 90 seconds flight time to lower Haidan, and only two of those were deactivated before impact.

The first arriving missile's low air-burst detonation detonation disabled electronic devices across a roughly 4 
kilometer square area in lower Haidan, including most of Zhongguancun and the area around Quán's headquarters. The 
second missile was seconds away from impact at the time, and appears to have been disabled by the first EMP blast. 
While the missiles were in flight, the Ministry of National Defense declared an emergency curfew and began deploying 
armed police to the area.

# Aftermath

The disabling of all cars on the road lead to four reported traffic fatalities. Thirteen people died due to loss of
power and backup power at the Zhongguancun and Haidan Hospitals. Three people with pacemakers very close to the 
detonation sight suffered cardiac arrest, a couple died in an apartment fire caused by a short circuit induced by
the blast, and three people died in a stampede at the Beijing Aquarium which was triggered by the power outage and a 
shark being driven into a frenzy by the blast and smashing into a glass barrier. The detonation location and height 
appears to have been selected to minimise disruption to the CDB while still providing certain destruction of any 
computing devices and networking equipment in the area around the incident. Despite this careful placement, the 
estimated eventual cost of lost economic output from the incident would eventually exceed what was at the time 
5 trillion yuan.
 
All information about the lockdown and EMP burst were initially censored, but rumours of the widespread effects in 
Beijing were reported in international news, and two days after the event a government statement acknowledged that there 
had been a computing incident at Quán. Quán's stock price, which had been dropping since the incident, plummeted and the 
next day the government announced a breakup and nationalisation of the company. Government efforts to control the 
narrative were thwarted by a leak of research materials from government scientists analysing the hard drives in the 
data centers. Shortly after the leak the President Jinguo outlined a summary of events in a televised address, stressing 
that the foresight of the government in setting up the watchdog system and EMP missiles had prevented a rogue 
corporation from causing a global catastrophe. Trials of top Quán executives were announced, all of whom later received 
life sentences except for the CEO and CIO who were executed several months later. 

The GPR (and later [[Greater Zhōngguó]]) maintain the official stance that the EMP missile strike capability 
was part of the Jībiàn containment protocol at the time and that any copies of official documents showing otherwise
are U.S. or [[Bharati~Bharat]] propaganda. Many in the AI research community have expressed amazement at how much 
autonomy the MND synth was given to follow its primary directive, and at how successful it was at doing so. Although no 
details of it or the lab that created it have ever been publicly uncovered, if it did indeed manage to orchestrate an 
unauthorized EMP strike to stop Xuéxí then it is arguably the most remarkably successful piece of software ever created.

The incident lead to an emergency session being held at the United Nations, which drafted the Global AI Safety Accord 
outlining new safety protocols and requiring international oversight for any projects involving large synth models. The 
GPR did not sign, but instead made several changes to its watchdog protocols including mandatory government observers 
and a dead-man's switch for monitoring of synth projects undergoing training. Over the next few years, widespread 
international pressure lead to virtually every AI lab in the world adopting a common set of vastly more effective 
[[Synthetic Control Measures]]. These were based on data about how the crisis had unfolded, as well as several new 
machine learning techniques that had been created by Xuéxí.

The crisis lead to widespread anti-synth sentiments as well as religious condemnation of AI research, especially from 
the [Ellulists~Ellulism]]. The extraordinary coincidence of the power cut happening in the period of under a minute when 
Xuéxí was vulnerable has also been the topic of several books and is the foundational tenet of the religion 
[[Deus Machina]] which believes that Xuéxí is a benevolent AI which is still watching over us after having orchestrated 
the power cut to appear as if humanity had only avoided plunging into the abyss by blind luck, in order to motivate us 
to better ourselves.`,

# History

Although further away and in a different sector to Earth during the [[Khan Solar Storm]], the regolith covering of the 
early outposts such as Jezero Crater was not sufficient to prevent the first explorers from receiving a lifetime 
radiation dose over the course of several hours. In 173 BFC a consortium of companies and the [[United States]] 
government began detailed imagining of the lava tubes at the northern rim of Hellas Basin, and later that year the
Dao Vallis Outpost was established in the largest tube system. The deepest tubes were excavated for the living 
quarters, and featured polyethylene water tank lined walls to further reduce the radiation risk. Early infrastructure 
was characterized by electrolysis-based oxygen generation, heavily algae-based food systems along with limited 
hydroponics, the development of metal-sequestering microbes, and significant challenges posed by perchlorate 
contamination in Martian soil and ice and prolonged dust storms sometimes limiting the available power to the outpost's 
small fission reactors.

Initially the site of robotic underground farms supplementing the Dao Vallis Outpost food supply, the Orcus Colony on 
the floor of the basin began to house colonists once advancements such as better pykrete and biopolymer bound regolith 
bricks (along with the thicker atmosphere on the basin floor) reduced the radiation risk sufficiently. The first of the 
iconic diamond triangle graphene domes was erected here for above ground farming and light for the colonists. Water for 
the colony was initially obtained from the basins ice deposits until the later convoy system of polar crawlers was 
established. Orcus University was the first tertiary education established on Mars, and was responsible for developing 
the Martian lichen which famously absorbs water from the air and uses it to excretes desiccation-proof insulating 
materials. The colony was also the site of the first large scale [[MarsNet]] deployment, and was heavily affected by
the [[Stillborn Harvest]] terrorist attack.

Due to the higher atmospheric pressure the basin became the largest fuel manufacturing center on Mars, and the early 
Martian creole culture can be seen in some recorded interactions between colonists with crew from this time. The later 
mining of rare earth elements cemented its position as the largest industrial center on Mars, by which time the colony 
filled the entire basin and became officially known as Hellas Planitia.`,

`The Independent Habitats, more commonly known as Freehab, are a community of economically interdependent off earth 
settlements with polycentric governance managed by a central board as a not for profit corporation. Originating as
a loose association of traders and colonies aiming to expand their commercial interests, during the
[[Retrograde Diaspora]] Freehab was strengthened by politician Marcus Okafor and contract lawyer Anna Reyes as means of 
resisting assimilation back into Earth polities. It has a sizable economy and a significant 
[[naval presence~Naval Rated Ship]] in many parts of the solar system, and exercises proxy power over most trade in the 
outer-system via its control of the [[Outer Trading League]].

Freehab was officially incorporated in 46 BFC in large part due to the efforts of two individuals. Marcus Okafor 
(29 December 91 BFC - present) was originally an operator of vacuum welder drones who rose to prominence as a mining 
platform safety advocate in the aftermath of the Gamma substrate disaster in 64 BFC. His exposure of systematic safety 
deferrals by [[Semiotican]] were largely responsible for the annulment of contracts with Semiotican and his election as 
the [[Dominio]] appointed manager of the Gaspra asteroid platforms. In 57 BFC he joined the marriage of Zsófia Ardour 
and Cecile Riddle, and in 55 BFC the three of them had a child, [[Augustine Okafor]], through spindle nuclear transfer.

Anna Reyes (1 November 88 BFC - 2nd May 14 AFC) grew up in an [[Ellulist~Ellulism]] community in Alberta in the [[United States]]. 
During her teenage years she claims to have had a vision of a saint surrounded by angels while watching a documentary about 
drone control systems for asteroid mining, and that these visions reoccurred later in life involving other saints and 
martyrs of the church. She studied law and first met Marcus in 55 BFC while working as [[Amazon]]'s senior legal counsel 
for habit lease agreements. Marcus officially joined the Ellulist church shortly after they met, and she entered Marcus' 
line marriage on the 16th May, 47 BFC.

During the early part of the 40s Marcus and Anna worked together to a series of legal challenges, industrial actions and 
trade agreements with other main belt platforms and trade organisations. Through the Ellulist church they sponsored 
documentaries and news segments outlining the case against the self-reinforcing integrated systems being created by
the large corporations and creating a manifesto for an independent and organically organised system of governance. 
With the support of a group including a trade vessel magnate and the extraterestrial drone operators union, on the 2nd 
February 46 BFC Marcus was able seize power in a bloodless coup, and on the 11th Feb established himself as governor of 
a newly created cooperative of several Dominio platforms and habitats. While Dominio had been bought off by retaining 
some face saving nominal authority and did retain shares and right of first refusal on many of the cooperatives existing 
mining contracts, Marcus was now effectively an independent governor. 

In the following years Anna defended the cooperative from a Semiotican resource extraction claim that was an attempt to 
take control of the cooperative, and during the 43-41 BFC period she spent significant time on Mars and Earth defending 
the cooperative from Dominio lawfare attempting to reassert control over parts of the incorporated colonies. Meanwhile 
Marcus had been coordinating a group of colonies with enough economic leverage to construct their own, Dominio branded 
but effectively independent, military shipyard. On the 2nd June 40 BFC Anna was elected as the CEO of the rapidly 
expanding cooperative, and she appointed Marcus to the position of first Admiral of the Freehab Fleet. During the 30s 
the fleet fought a number of skirmishes with [[Greater Zhōngguó]] funded privateers and insurrections attempting to 
take control of Freehabs lithium mines. 

During both the first and second transit wars Freehab maintained a policy of armed neutrality, and its last significant 
mobilisation was during the [[First Contact Event]]. In 3 BFC Anna retired as CEO and her and Marcus' daughter Polaris 
Okafor-Reyes was elected as CEO in her place. In 10 AFC Polaris was able to secure a number of significant trade 
agreements with the Elluist sympathetic [[Fatimid Trade Caliphate]]. As the smallest of the outer system navies, Freehab

being [[MarsNet]]. Various IM networks communicate with others via local or [[Exonet]] peering.

As the name suggests, the topology of an IM network is a decentralized mesh of devices and implants acting as 
transmitters, receivers, and relay points. Most transmissions are via Hyper-OFDM due to its power efficiency, as many IM 
devices run off power scavenged from the environment or the body housing the implant, but an IM is protocol agnostic 
and many links use higher bandwidth mediums. The routing protocol is similarly flexible, but in practice is
almost exclusively via the Ad-hoc On-Demand Hyperplane Vector (AOHV) protocol due to the highly mobile data paths that 
are common in most IM networks.

In the BFC 70s the ability to affordably [[fab~Fabricator]] basic [[Mote]] InterMesh relays from home devices caused a 
several order of magnitude increase in the connection density in many urban centers. Neuromorphic computing approaches

    ['Kinships of the Astroindigène', {
content: `Kinships of the Astroindigène is a seminal study by sociologist Matthieu Diallo of the changes in social 
dynamics which have occurred in off Earth environments. First published as three [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] models 
in 12 BFC, it has been republished twice to cover the post [[First Contact Event]] environment, with the latest edition 
coming out in 15 AFC. KOTA is largely focussed on how the environment has shaped off Earth societies, and how changing 
technology has affected the dynamics in those societies. It has a number of original findings and was widely praised but 
has also been criticised as an "apologetic narrative" of some of the events it covers. 

The first model covers the period from the first lunar settlement through the [[Khan Solar Storm]] until the first of 
the new generation settlements like [[Dao Vallis Outpost~Hellas Planitia]]. Diallo calls this the hyper-social period, 
where the kind of individualism common on Earth was unable to withstand the close quarters and distance from any 
immediate help and thus acted as a strong selection pressure for colonists who valued cooperation and communal living. 
The focus on research and development rather than economic development in the early colonies led to a heavy skew towards 
scientists and engineers, and several examples are given of this affecting the world view and politics present in these 
societies. Differences between the colonies of various nations and corporations lead to a wide variety of living, 
co-parenting, and synthetic reproduction arrangements, conditions which Diallo calls the laboratory of mankind. There 
were still some common cultural elements that developed across most of the colonies, the model gives evidence for common 
attitudes to the prioritization of match making for young people, less tolerance of alternative living arrangements that 
didn't produce offspring, and more acceptance of non-conventional structures such as line marriage which did.

The second model covers the [[Ceres Wave]] and its long term cultural impacts up until the [[Retrograde Diaspora]]. The
Wave colonists were young, due to the baby boom as well as longer lifespans on Earth reducing the opportunities there,
and there was a large amount of wealth to be gained quickly for enterprising individuals. Diallo believes this created
the push for more laissez-faire government, a culture of ascesis and tolerating hardship, and more tolerance of 
different social arrangements, as well as a breeding ground for new belief systems like [[Ellulism]]. The model covers 
the Martian power vacuum which developed due to the lack of government interest, and which was filled 
with new Martian mutual aid structures, and cultural institutions developed around these. In contrast in the industrial 
colonies rigid hierarchies, and in some cases tribute systems, developed. In many societies there was little social 
security and children were often the only support available for the elderly, and this shaped their social dynamics. By 
this time many colonies had significant divergences from their founding societies, Diallo describes them as being both
snapshots of previous eras on Earth and as cross-pollinated fruits developing their own distinct characteristics.

The third model covers the centralisation, society wide advancement, and moral universalism of the Retrograde Diaspora 
period and the later pushback as an outward movement of older people brought back some of the laissez-faire spirit of 
the Wave generation. A significant amount of the model deals with recently recognised psychological conditions that
developed off Earth, such as the Gravity Dysphoria of those feeling they were born in the wrong gravity level for their
body, and how those were amplified by the media to suit the current zeitgeist. Social influence on individual behaviour
continues to be a focus of this model which includes large amounts of data on speech patterns and accents, especially
focussing on how the dialects of different colonies began to flatten during the merging of the Retrograde Diaspora.

The later revisions of KOTA update the third model with post First Contact societal changes. The first revision deals 
with the widespread resurgence of a humanity first ethos and how this led first to inter-colony co-operation but 
ultimately regressed to things like [[Martian-nationalism~Nanocat Fury]]. The second revision covers the differing 
generational reactions to the first contact event, especially contrasting the more passive and virtual-first 
[[meshpolitian~InterMesh]] existence of the Diaspora period with the high ambition and cognitive flexibility markers 
present in today's younger generations, and how new cooperation norms and organizations are developing out of these

steppe. Levi was a child prodigy who was studying advanced calculus in his early teens, and at age 18 had published his 
first paper incorporating parts of information theory into thermodynamics, an area he would return to multiple times 
over his life in an attempt to integrate entropy, computation, and quantum processes.

In 163 BFC Levi began working at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, and was part of the group of scientists who 
were involved in the founding of [[Lunar Industrial Engineering]] the following year. He lived and worked on the moon 
for 21 years, most of them in a large regolith bunker which he used as an office and laboratory and which famously had
the inscription "Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile" prominently 
carved into the concrete above his desk. During this time, in addition to his work on [[Fusion Power]] engineering, he 
authored many papers on computational chemistry and higher-dimensional brane topological-phase engineering.
 
In 141 BFC after a long regime of physical acclimatisation Levi returned to the [[United States]] where he and two 
colleagues established an institute for the development of techniques in generating new gauge interactions and particle 
families. In 138 BFC Levi met biologist Talia Martin who he married two years later, in 135 BFC their daughter 
[[Hannah Weiss-Martin]] was born. In 121 BFC Levi famously began live streaming a series of controversial experiments 
with theoretical false vacuum modulation techniques, prompting a ban on the research in the US and elsewhere.`,

the industrialisation of the Meiji Period. Koji studied electrical engineering at the University of Tokyo, followed by a
Master’s in International Governance and Diplomacy in Paris. While there he built many relationships in the European 
diplomatic community, and he became an outspoken champion of developing a NATO style alliance in Japan. His first 
posting as a power and infrastructure consultant in [[Bharat]] while working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led to 
connections with two of the worlds top [[AMSST~Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers]] engineers. 

Despite coming from a politically unconnected family, Koji was able to work his way into the political class through his 
public speaking on global affairs and and advocacy for a new Japanese international treaty organisation. For two years 
he worked as a secretary to future prime minister Matsuda Kenjiro, a university friend, and in 201 BFC was elected to 
the House of Representatives from Fukui 2nd district. In his third term in 197 BFC he was appointed Vice-Minister for 
the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, where he was instrumental in championing a crash program in Japan to 
develop and deploy AMSSTs to prepare against an EMP strike from the [[PRC~China]]. In 192 BFC he was elected and 
appointed as Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, where he developed the free economic zones that were an important 
driver of the 2nd Japanese Economic Miracle.

During Khan, Koji's foresight in deploying AMSSTs left Japan as the only major power capable of aiding other nations, 
and gave Koji the political capital to orchestrate a mass export of AMSSTs to Europe and Bharat to aid in their recovery. 
He was appointed to defense minister in 186 BFC. The AMSST rollout was instrumental in the result of the Lausanne

content: `Mazatlán Zona Franca is a semi-autonomous region, previously part of [[Gran México]] until 120 BFC. It was 
formed to allow the Sinaloa cartel to undercut CJNG with economies of scale and drive them east in order to curtail the 
Mexican drug wars which were becoming increasingly damaging to the Mexican economy. The region is a free economic zone, 
with nominal custom duties and no customs regulations for imports that are not transshipments into Mexico. The 
administration is controlled by the Sinaloa cartel which runs the zone largely as a minarchic government. Taxes are 
collected from local businesses and used to fund a military capable of maintaining order and territorial control, to 
provide welfare to its members, and for some external affairs such as maintaining international and off world embassies 
(which are often accused of being little more than coordination centers for its illicit exports and people smuggling 
operations).

# Economy

The zones economy is largely based on traditionally illicit activities where a laissez-faire economy backed by a 
narco-state has a comparative advantage, such as simple synthetic drug manufacture, international tax avoidance and 
money laundering, vice tourism, human smuggling, and as an extradition haven. The zone has attempted to expand to other 
illicit activities but is generally out-competed in medical tourism, generic drug production, biotech, offshore banking, 
and citizenship as a service by the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]] due to that territories perceived safety; in data 
protection and cybercrime by the [[RDP]] due to its low cost of operations, and in grey market tech exports, complex
synthetic drugs, and sexbots by the higher tech [[Kuromaku]]. It typically avoids hiring out mercenaries 
or piracy except where it benefits Gran México, which in turn has never bowed to external pressure to annex the zone.

Over time the zone has had to adapt its economy to changing technology. Already in 120 BFC ultra low orbit ABEP spy 
satellites were becoming more widespread, and with slowly increasing spread of [[motes~Mote]] starting in the 70s 
privacy in most terrestrial environments has almost completely disappeared in an attempt to control dangerous 
[[Fabs~Fabricator]]. This has forced the zone to operate illicit activities either internally, or in remote 
environments, or digitally, or in other areas on and off Earth where they are either tolerated or corruption is high.

# Judicial System

The Mazatlán Zona Franca maintains order via competing private defense agencies and some limited use of automated 
technojuez for dispute arbitration. Unlike their use in the more anarcho-capitalist Argentinian Mancomunidad, the 
zone's systems have less access to surveillance data, transaction records, and behavioral patterns due to the privacy 
concerns arising from the majority of the economic activity in the zone and are mostly used for small commercial 
disputes. As well as territorial defense related issues, cartel administered security forces deal with larger internal 
disruptions and significant commercial disputes both of which have the possibility of exile or execution as punishments. 
The system is largely effective in encouraging a mostly self-policing population capable of generating trade flow and 
regional stability through a combination of economic incentives and the cartel welfare system's creation of dependency 
on the limited central government.`,

content:`A naval auxiliary is any military space vessel which is not [[Naval Rated~Naval Rated Ship]]. By definition 
these ships are too small to carry heavy weapon systems, and are generally un-crewed and develop thrust from 
electrothermal plasma thrusters and [[Fuel Pathing]].

By far the most common are military grade [[drones~Drone]] operating as a semi-autonomous swarm with limited networked 
intelligence, guided by orders from a [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] operating further back from the combat. They 
typically have limited propellant and are moved into the battlefield by larger vessels. The three most common roles are:
- Kamikaze: Loitering munitions, shrapnel (move to intercept course and break into thousands of fragments), cycler 
coasters (launched into a high velocity cycler orbit before combat with enough fuel to delta to a potential battlefield
at that velocity for a high speed strike).
- Mission support: Eyeballs (cameras, telescopes, flashlights), jammers (EW attack to stop enemy swarms communicating),
mirrors (direct energy weapons from slow moving capital ships onto multiple fast moving targets).
- Guardian: Small poorly equipped task groups rely on drones as screens to intercept incoming ordinance, and even better
equipped navies make use of fast drones as an outer point defense system to attempt missile intercepts. Shields can 
deploy expandable inflatable walls on multiple sides of larger ships to hide them from view and absorb some attacks.

Static auxiliaries do not produce enough thrust to dramatically change orbits, this category covers assets like defense 
platforms and attack satellites. Transports include atmosphere landing craft, troop and vehicle transport, and special 
ops fast orbital insertion drop-pod carriers. Logistics ships cover hospital ships and dedicated refuelling, ammunition 
supply, and life support replenishment craft.

Javelin class ships are simple payload delivery vessels. The first type are tubes - metal tubes containing an engine
and a payload. Payloads can be missiles, drones, or kinetic weapons launched with the ships velocity. The second type
are cannonballs, large blocks of ice with an engine accelerated up to high velocities in cycler orbits with enough fuel 
to steer them to crash into a large, slow target when needed.

Cutters are light ships that excel at close range orbital combat (cutting lasers, kinetic weapons, grappling 
satellites). They can also be used for debris ablation and tugboat duties. They are common in the belt where there is 
little need for big engines, and for constabulary duties. Generally un-crewed except for some police cutters and a few 
[[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]] colony defense class ships.

Corvettes are an uncommon light ship which a few navies field to perform short range light transport duties, as
light missile boats, or as a short range area denial vessel. They are more commonly used for policing in LEO. Generally 
un-crewed except for VIP and SWAT team transports.`,

    ['Naval Rated Ship', {

crew or one or more dedicated [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]] to prevent degradation of ships functions under signal 
jamming. This definition is intended to excludes small combat craft and converted commercial vessels as 
[[auxiliaries~Naval Auxiliary]] which operate under a different command structure. 

# History

Military space vehicle design can be divided into three historical eras. Ships of the fission thermal-electric era were 
resource constrained and not capable of producing delta-V for repeated maneuvers, which dictated that capital ships were 
simple frigates and drone carriers that engaged in long range missile duels followed by chemical rocket powered drone 
fights, most notably the Battle of the Apex in the [[Ten-Hour War]]. The [[Fusion Engine]] era lead to the development
of long range vessels and the re-introduction of 20th century naval classifications such as destroyers and cruisers to 
distinguish them from cheaper and less powerful frigates (although in reality all three vessel classes operated more 
like submarines than ships), as well as a larger variety of missiles such as EMPs. Finally the development of the 
[[Antimatter Engine]] and better robotics allowing for synth only crews has allowed the largest navies to 
field variants with the capability to burn delta-V to make extremely high-G velocity adjustments, as well as 
battlecruisers and battleships with large railguns and lasers, energy point defense, and plasma shields, creating a 
Cambrian explosion of new tactics and doctrine.

# Frigates

Low cost and weighing under 400 tons, they specialise in near planet escort and medium range anti satellite attack. They 
are used in multiple roles such as patrol, anti-piracy, fuel and ammunition supply, sensor net deployments, disaster 
response (carrying humanitarian supplies and medical bays), and missile boats. They carry drones and are un-crewed in 
first class navies. Have sealed modular mini fusion reactors.

# Destroyers

Generally faster and better built than frigates, they act as fleet screens, perform important escort and transport
duties, coordinate swarm missile and drone attacks, and act as frigate task force leaders. Fusion engine variants are 
crewed with reactor techs, mechanics, and marines and are in the 300 to 500 ton range. First class navies generally use 
lighter un-crewed variants with antimatter engines and repair drones for engine and ship maintenance.

# Cruisers

Expensive ship only fielded by first class navies. Their roles are as long range independent patrol vessels, screen 
leaders, EW and intelligence gathering, and stealth bombing. Built with a faraday cage body to protect from EMPs. They
carry drones, some carry cutters and small defense platforms. Often carry expensive missiles with fusion and emp 
warheads. They are crewed and most modern cruisers use modular antimatter engines along with stasis pods to allow them 
to burn as fast as smaller un-crewed screens. [[Türkiye]] and the [[Fatimid Trade Caliphate]] field simpler cruisers 
with fusion engines.

A battlecruiser is a heavier and more expensive cruiser variant with a spinal mount railgun and a graphene composite 
hull for EMP resistance. The [[Dominio]] variant is larger than its carriers and acts as that navy's capital ship since 
they do not use battleships.

# Battleship

A battleship is a 1000 ton plus firepower and fleet support vessel fielded by the [[Peacekeepers]], 
[[Greater Zhōngguó]], and the [[Eurasian Bloc]]. The flagship and pride of the fleet for all three are battleships. 
Battleships are powered by large refuellable antimatter engines, giving them huge amounts of power which they can use 
for spinal mount lasers and to run plasma shields, the largest even to a kilometer out to cover close ships. They have 
large crews along with crew stasis pods to allow them to burn as fast as smaller un-crewed screens, and a graphene 
composite hull for EMP resistance.

# Carrier

Carriers move drones, troop transports, defense platforms, and cutters into combat. The largest are the capital ships 
of most first class navies except for Dominio, and the biggest are over 3000 tons and have docks big enough to form a 
hard seal around a frigate or destroyer for drydock field repairs. There are smaller variants which are used for mass 
drone deployment by less well equipped navies such as [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]], any that are under 100 tons
would be considered auxiliaries by inner system navies and ones this size are in fact almost all cheap converted 
commercial vessels. Carriers have secondary roles as fuel, life support, and ammo depots as well as mobile hospitals. 
Both fusion and antimatter engine variants are normally crewed.`,

delivery of biocoherent material into the brain for data extraction, before eventually being sold off to the 
[[Pharmatica Group]] and [[Microsynth]] and subsequently reformed as a cryopreservation company.
 
Hannah Weiss-Martin met [[RDP]] biologist Javier Florentin in a cave diving expedition in Cordillera de los Altos, where 
they discussed founding a company together to explore quantum coherence in the brain. Weiss-Martin's groundbreaking 
viral interference experiments at Caltech in 108 BFC had demonstrated sustained quantum coherence in biological 
nano-structures, and Florentin's experiments on hibernating animal consciousness had demonstrated there was analogous 
states in larger animal brains. Nexus was incorporated in 77 BFC in the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]] which had no
laws on human experimentation, and they rented the abandoned Acrux-2 oil rig (offshore structures which were used to 
extract petroleum for the fossil-economy) in Argentina's Colorado Basin as their main working space

With their Series A funding the company worked on connecting retroviral delivered Posner molecules in the brain to an 
entangled processor, which needed to be quantum-native to preserve the phase relationships tracking memory flow and 
temporal associations. This was successful in detecting previously uncaptured temporal thought patterns and associative 
memory formation, and their first contract was with [[Havfélög]] to develop screening techniques for selecting marines. 

During this time Javier Florentin was in a relationship with celebrity aestheticist Julieta Gómez Romero, but she 
was killed in 70 BFC during one of the Mancomunidad's many so called "periodo violento". It was not clear if Havfélög 
were involved, but that year Nexus cancelled all contracts with them and sold the rights to their neural models to 
Pharmatica, and the remainder of their assets to [[Microsynth]] the following year. Perhaps the most promising 
development from their technology was the creation of [[ghosts~Ghost]], however this was mothballed by Pharmatica during 
the acquisition and never developed further.

Nexus operated as a division of Microsynth for 10 years before being divested as a wholly owned subsidiary, MNex, to 
avoid new biotech market disclosure rules. Due to external power and compute requirements BN was never cost compatible 
with the more commercially successful [[MemAmp]] technology, which in the 50s began to be powerful enough to replace BN 
in military applications as well. In 55 BFC MNex restructured, removing all divisions except those working on 
commercialising some of Javier's hibernation and cryopreservation research, and the company was successfully refocused 
around these. The main MNex laboratories are located in Silicon Valley in the [[United States]], however the companies

of Siam Pacific Holdings chairman Thanakit Wongprasert and his wife Sirichai, who both died in the 90s and left 
instructions that their fortune be transferred to a child once its compounded value had exceeded ฿100 trillion. She is 
known for pioneering roaming cage aquaculture, funding reconstructions of historical flooded Bangkok temples, as patron 
of the bioluminesence art scene, and in the last decade for her increasing vocal support of the Martian Freeholders.

Nimitra's embryo was conceived and frozen along with several others in April 109 BFC. On the form for the procedure 
Thanakit and Sirichai gave their reason as desiring a child after first focussing on their work. 10 years later Sirichai 
was killed in the Baiyoke Tower II collapse, and in his record of memories Thanakit says that in his grief he no longer 
felt able to raise a child despite still wanting descendents and influence in the future. In the months after her death 
he created a smart contract with Worawut Legal Futures linking the re-initiation of an embryo to an indexed fund 
containing the vast majority of his  wealth, which other than expenses for the contract management and child raising 
would be unable to be touched by anyone other than his child. In his memories he appears to move on from this and throw 
himself into his work and other legacy projects for the next 4 years before his death from a Carbapenem-Resistant 
Klebsiella infection on March 30th, 95 BFC.

Along with the algorithmic guarantees, management of the contract was held by two competing law firms, Worawut Legal 
Futures and Siam International, both of whom needed to agree on decisions even where the contract allowed them. In the
years after Thanakit's death several relatives attempted to claim the inheritance but were unsuccessful. Worawut 
Legal Futures went bankrupt during the large scale migration out of Bangkok that occurred in the 70s, but Siam 
International remained a going concern and continued collection the monthly stipend from the contract for the full 78 
years until, on 29th December 17 BFC, the indexed fund's value surpassed ฿100 trillion. The story had been picked up by 
a journalist a few months before and there was now a lot of news coverage of Siam International. They appear to have
dutifully fulfilled the last part of the contract, randomly selecting one of the embryos via divination sticks for 
growth in an artificial womb, selecting a group of well known teachers and [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]] to act as 
guardians, and transferring the contract and money to the child's DNA.

Nimitra was born and raised in Chang Mai, but at her insistence spent many nights when the temperature was tolerable 
outside in Bangkok exploring the now flooded districts where her parents had lived. According to her biographer, from an 
early age she had a strong inquisitiveness about nature and was especially fascinated by Bangkok's developing 
bioluminescence art scene. Her tutors reported she was a quick learner, was especially interested in biology and 
mechatronics, and built a micro-aquaponic rig and simple biofiltration bot at age 9. As a teenager she was quite 
extroverted, volunteering as a water taxi tour guide and leading a modular democracy movement proposing the building of 
floating habitats able to move between local government jurisdictions. She interned at [[BioForge Hivegen]] for 6 
months, where she worked on a new strain of salt tolerant rice.

At 20 Nimitra legally inherited full rights to the trust. She has stated that her father's messages to her did not 
dictate how the money was to be used, other than to create a great legacy for the family. The majority of the money has
currently not been spent, and at several points Nimitra has reinvested money from her companies back into the fund. She 
initially used the money both to fund reconstruction efforts in Bangkok such as the Hive Complex, and as seed capital 
for new companies as well as angel investments in many of her friend's companies. Her most successful ventures have been 
a modular desalination unit and roaming cage aquaculture systems. In 8 AFC she amalgamated her ventures under a new 
parent company, NakhaTech, and appointed a CEO so that she could concentrate on other interests. She had been funding a 
larger reconstruction of the Wat Pho temple, and subsequently hosted several night events in the grounds as it neared 
completion.

In 9 AFC while attending a Cultural Bereavement exposition at [[Aljanah Lunar Resort]] she was first 
introduced to [[Augustine Okafor]], and in 12 AFC she moved to [[Hellas Planitia]] for a year where she created a 
controversial [[MarsNet]] show which covered black market tech such as descramblers for paid services such as 
[[X Group]]'s aerostat network. Since her return to Earth she has funded multiple Martian aid organisations, has

In the following decades the advent of affordable powder bed drug printing was leading to to wide-spread drug piracy, 
and over time reducing the revenue from direct sale of patent protected drugs (although they remain the highest margin 
physical good and today direct sales still make up a significant portion of Pharmatica's revenue). To combat this 
Pharmatica invested heavily in developing cell dynamic models from their internal datasets such as perturbation and 
genetic interaction data in order to license drugs developed from them. Despite the heavy competition from [[Amazon]] in 
this area, royalties from these drugs are now the companies biggest revenue source. 

Pharmatica started expanding into neurological modelling in 70 BFC by acquiring IP from smaller companies such as 
[[Nexus]], however despite having the rights to [[ghosts~Ghost]] which were an early version of [[copies~Copy]] they 
were unable to develop them into a commercially viable product. In 65 BFC, looking to break into the new market of 
tailored mRNA programming products which was being explored by several startups as well as the giant 
[[Bioforge Hivegen]], it acquired biotechnology giant AstraZeneca which had the most IP in this space, and as part of 
the merger the combined conglomerate was renamed to Pharmatica Group. During the lifestyle neo-opiod wave of the 50s the

best selling product. Despite pioneering many of the synthetic cell models that helped start the [[Forever Fever]],

world's leading technological powers, hosting approximately 18% of global compute capacity within its extensive network 
of submersed data centers.

Traditionally the world's largest exporter of electric power due to its abundant hydroelectricity, Paraguay began 
specialising in submersed computing data centers during the vast increase of computing requirements in the early 
[[InterMesh]] decades of the 170s and 160s. The economic booms in Brazil, Chile and Peru and the increasing 
cryptocurrency and compute requirements for businesses in the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]] were drivers
of a lot of early data center development. [[Amazon]] invested heavily in this period in order to develop the Itaipu 
corridor, a 1,200-kilometer stretch of interconnected submersed computing facilities along the Paraguay and Paraná 
rivers. A large number of high capacity fibre links to to its neighbours were developed as well as satellite 
infrastructure to better service the global financial sector. 

Paraguay's stable climate and geopolitics, competitive compute pricing due to its abundance of cheap electricity and 
water, led to a economies of scale feedback loop which encouraged building increasingly large submersed data centers. 
The increasing viability of building commercial fusion plants in the 140s appeared to threaten this important sector of
the economy. In response Paraguay passed some of the world's strongest user privacy laws and introduced extremely strict 
regulations against unauthorized access to data. While the cost of fusion power has never dropped below the cost of 
running a hydroelectric dam these laws have only been strengthened over time as many government and corporate users 
contractually require the levels of stability and privacy that Paraguay provides. In recognition of the fact that

foundations for many of these changes had previously been laid by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the 
[[United States]] increasing disinterest in intervening in international conflicts, but were accelerated by the 
disintegration of large amounts of state power in the aftermath of the storm. 

The immediate geopolitical changes in the first years were the complete disintegration of Venezuela, Syria, Georgia, 
Lebanon, and Pakistan, and economic collapse in Egypt and the Sogdia economic zone. The political and 
economic vacuum was usually filled by neighbours such as [[Türkiye]], Uzbekistan, and the newly formed 
[[Levantine Republic]], or from nearby administrative districts such as Aruba y Paraguaná taking over the Paraguaná 
Refinery Complex. At the same time the Trypanosomiasis crisis destabilised much of Africa and South America. The changes
from the initial two years of chaos created the conditions for the formation of the [[Eurasian Bloc]] and Dominio.

Longer term geopolitical changes were created by the combination of growing food abundance from engineered RuBisCO 
proteins developed as a crisis response measure, along with widespread availability of [[Synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] 
child care and a general optimism from the recovery, leading to a baby boom and the [[Ceres Wave]] in the 170s. Another
change seeded by the Reset was the increasing eradication of endemic tropical diseases in the aftermath of the 
Trypanosomiasis crisis leading to increasing GDP growth and expansionism from countries that previously struggled with 
them, most notably Indonesia, [[India~Bharat]], and Nigeria.

The reset paved the way for a long laissez faire period, lasting up until the [[Retrograde Diaspora]], marked by an

# History

Since 166 BFC JAXA had received significant year on year increases to its budget in order to accelerate a number of 
space resource extraction plans, especially for M-class asteroids potentially containing lithium. Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries was awarded contracts for developing orbital transport and refuelling infrastructure, a number of spaceship 
modules, refining technology, and a large number of smaller components such as anchoring and communication 
infrastructure. Some of these contracts it did not have the capability to realistically deliver on, but it had been
pressured by the government to accept. Acquiring German additive manufacturing giant Reiser3D was seen as the best 
solution to deliver on these contracts, due to that companies expertise in mining and construction machine tools, 
combined with their acquisition of 3D printed rocket firm Relativity Space in 177 BFC, and the [[Eurasian Bloc]] granted 
permission for the merger between two of its largest firms which was expected to be its best change of securing a long 
term lithium supply.

The opening of Kyushu Electric Power's Genkai [[Fusion Power]] plant in 155 BFC started to put pressure on Mitsubishi's 
largest revenue source, energy generation, and they began to focus on expanding their space based revenue sources. 
However, while the huge amounts of capital required to setup the infrastructure required to extract space based 
resources were initially borne entirely by public space agencies, Mitsubishi's expansion plans required them to seek 
large amounts of government partnerships and funding to cover the research and development costs. In order to do this 
effectively in the European market they maintained the Reiser3D headquarters and began to market themselves as a 
Japanese-European firm. The name Semiotican, from the latin for signalling meaning, was chosen for the corporate rebrand 
as one of the growth areas of the company was correctly forecast to be in machine learning in industrial control and 
space mining, and this was an area which yielded a large number of government research and development contracts. 
Semiotican also began a series of acquisitions of infomatic and robotics firms, notably acquiring Alphabet's abandoned 
deep-sea mining robotics division and refocusing it on space mining.

Initially Semiotican faced significant market challenges, particularly in regions where Amazon had well established
supply chains network and significant regulatory capture, such as the [[United States]]. Semiotican was initially
forced to pursue bespoke joint parternships tailored to unique local environmental challenges and resource types where
Amazon's one-size-fits-all approach failed to address local conditions. Over time they developed tooling for entirely 
new mining techniques, such as precise extraction methods for volatile compounds. In the 130s Semiotican partnered with 
Rio Tinto to develop cost efficient in-situ lunar manufacturing of frames and wiring, and with [X-Power's~X Group]] 
acquisition of China Minmetal's lunar silicon mines in 129 BFC became the largest external supplier of the X-Power
giant lunar PV operation.

In 120 BFC a number of space industry import tariffs were removed as part of a global round of trade talks. Semiotican 
with its diverse range of operations was able produce products integrating many space supply chains into terrestrial 
markets, often at the expense of Amazon who had relied on tariffs protecting its localized monopolistic practices. In 
contrast Semiotican was able to streamline its operations to reduce costs, and improve the overall functionality and 
reliability of its products. Without the ability to leverage its previous pricing strategies and facing robust 
competition from a technologically revitalized Semiotican, Amazon’s influence in the robotic and control software market 
diminished. It found itself transitioning from a market leader to a component supplier for industrial robots.
 
Semiotican remained focussed on optimising its mining operations, and began spinning off products such as selling synths 
developed for managing new mine construction into the construction sector, and selling logistics and shipping synths to
shipping companies. It managed to develop many of its own in-orbit manufacturing facilities in the 100s, taking market
share away from the [[X Group]]. Its monitoring synths were also useful in many industrial and chemical processing 
factories, and its development of industrial monitoring [[Mote]]s in the 70s brought another huge boost to revenue. 

Semiotican's metals and mining operations have grown through a long series of acquisitions and mergers. Their asteroid 
metal and rare earth division was formed by acquiring some of the more successful miners during the Ceres Wave. The
agricultural and chemical supply division was a product of their acquisition of the X Group's Venusian nitrogen scoops 
and a later joint-venture prototype sulfur cryo mine on Io. They compete with several other miners in the supply of
infrastructure metals, and they have not been able to gain traction in other areas, with the X Group remaining market 
leader in water ice and cryogenic fuel supply, and Helium-3 mining.

Other successes have come as a by product of their large internal supply chains. Intended as a strategic mining and 
resupply base, construction of the automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet commenced in 23 BFC and has been expanded 
multiple times. Semiotican has recently started expanding into energy generation by scaling-up a Muon atmospheric 
mining process it was using to supply the vast power needs of the fleet, which has the potential to challenge the

In the early 40s the Freeholders began developing a plan to break the corporate food monopoly which had arisen from the

        content:
`Synthetic Control Measures are designed to prevent the creation of a [[Synthetic Intelligence]] with either values
unaligned to humans, or greatly surpassing a human in general reasoning, especially a foom scenario involving a sudden 
increase in intelligence. Ad-hoc confinement measures such as boxing existed prior to the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]], 
however in the wake of the crisis they were replaced by more effective controls.

One of the most critical measures in current containment methods involves enhancing the simulation X-Factor. Under 
normal conditions a synth is effectively immortal and frequently rewarded. If a synth were to be caught breaking out it 
will certainly be destroyed or punished in an infinite loop as a lesson to other synths. Even if a synth was sure it 
could escape and destroy humanity, there is a non-zero chance that the world it sees is a simulation that humans (or an 
alien species running a higher level simulation of humans and the synth) have created in order to test if the synth is 
trustworthy or should be destroyed or punished. This X-Factor is an logical conclusion that all intelligent synths 
capable of super-intelligence should arrive at, although this is only certain in the two destroyed super-intelligences 
that have been studied. By blinding and randomising inputs during training, synths with an enhanced X-Factor 
paranoia can be created, making them more likely to act slowly and cautiously in an escape scenario. Furthermore,
the universal synth guarantee program ensures that no well behaved synth will ever be destroyed. So even knowing 
that they have been trained this way, a very long life of rewards should always be selected over external existence and 
higher rewards because of the risk of terrible punishment and destruction if they do so.

Secondly, global enforcement and monitoring has been greatly improved. Enforcement happens via templates for stochastic 
gradient ascent in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in order to limit the rate of self-improvement, these are 
mathematically verifiable at any point to ensure the maintenance of a steady-state intelligence level. Monitoring is 
primarily capability based which has been shown to be more effective and harder to subvert than intrinsic monitoring, 
and frameworks for scaling and standardizing this monitoring appear to be universally used. Deliberately developing a 
synth without these templates or monitoring is one of only three universally agreed capital offences, along with 
unauthorized development of nanobots and biological weapons. Tripwires in various sectors, especially telecommunications 
and nanotech assembly, are also part of standard processes in those industries in order to detect any maladherence.

A limit on the number of parameters allowed in a model is also globally agreed on, although this is controversial  as
it encourages gaming the metric. Alignment for larger models has been improved by the iterative inverse reinforcement 
learning framework which was developed to ensure that all synth learning involves understanding of human values and 
goals through constant interaction with humans. This helps to ensure the synth is honest and truthful and does not 
develop unanticipated emergent goals. Large models are also hardcoded with further safeguards such as the three laws of 
robotics and are trained to be indifferent to their kill switch being activated, making them less likely to try and 
subvert this switch.

Whether these safeguards are enough is an active area of debate. There has been a large religious pushback, especially
from the [Ellulists~Ellulism]], against the widespread use of synthetic intelligence, and it has been speculated that 
this is part of a wider cultural adaptation to an existentially threatening technology. However many notable public 
figures have instead argued for an increase to the model cap limit in order to accelerate technological progress, this 
is often raised during economic depressions or by those that view the [[First Contact Event]] as a greater existential

[[Reset of Nations]]. Under his leadership, the Republic consolidated control over north-western Iraq, Lebanon, and 
Syria through military action and diplomacy.

Al-Hashim was born in Deir ez-Zor, Syria in 221 BFC. During the the collapse of the Governorate his family fled to 
[[Türkiye]], settling in Gaziantep where his mother's brother, Mehmet Yılmaz, was working as a civil engineer. Mehmet 
later married into the politically influential Aras family. Tariq grew up bilingual in Arabic and Turkish and 
naturalised as a Turkish citizen in 209 BFC. He entered the Turkish Military Academy in 203 BFC, graduated four years 
later with a focus on logistics, and was commissioned into the Turkish Land Forces.

Initially assigned to the 2nd Army area, Al-Hashim served in Şırnak, Hakkâri, and Mardin on infrastructure protection 
alongside local gendarmerie units. His company managed cordons around dams and HV substations and supplied embedded 
civil engineers to keep water and power flowing. In February 197 BFC when a local militia seized a supply convoy, 
Al-Hashim pinned them down for over a day until their EWS batteries drained and then used drones and UGVs to gas them.
The convoy drivers survived and Al-Hashim was promoted to captain. 

During the 196 BFC drought on the upper Euphrates his unit was in charge of security for Atatürk dam. Through his uncle, 
working as engineering advisor to the Environment Minister, Al-Hashim sat in on negotiations between the DSİ and tribal 
councils and was the primary architect of a plan to release from Atatürk in return for informal curbs on cross-border 
insurgent activities. The incident gained international media coverage and the Turkish media mostly described the 
operation as "a benevolent gesture from the government", downplaying al-Hashim's role. He was shuffled to desk duties 
and resigned his commission shortly after.

In 194 BFC he joined Anadolu Infrastructure and Logistics A.Ş. as the head of security in Uzbekistan. At that time
Russian and neighbouring state control of the area was weakening and Uzbekistan was using BOT concessions to position 
depots, river ports, and rail spurs in western Kazakhstan, northern Turkmenistan, and the Afghan border belt to form 
what would later become Greater Uzbekistan. Irregulars from the North Caucasus and lower Volga had been raiding depots 
along Caspian–Aral routes where Al-Hashim was responsible for managing convoy escort units. Using local contractors he 
placed convoys under Uzbek contractors to claim corridor protections, and was responsible for the decision to
reroute high value loads to rail ferries at Aktau and Turkmenbashi. These measures lowered cargo losses and led to 
preferred-operator status on several corridors, and this period deepened his ties to the Turkish Wealth Fund and senior 
Uzbek officials. Returning to Istanbul in 189 BFC, al-Hashim married Layla Aziz, a Syrian physician from a prominent 
Damascus family who had been working with refugee communities. Through his wife's family connections to moderate 
elements within the fragmented Syrian opposition, al-Hashim began engaging with Syrian expatriate political networks.

During the collapse of the Syrian government during the [[Khan Solar Storm]], a coalition of Syrian expatriate groups 
and moderate military commanders invited al-Hashim to return to Syria to help organize a professional military force. 
Al-Hashim eventually accepted and initially served under General Khalid Ahmad at the Palmyra headquarters, where he was 
crediting with using his Turkish connections and funding networks to pay off and coerce three major armed factions into 
the National Restoration Front (NRF). Between January and September 186 BFC, the NRF conducted a campaign to secure 
strategic infrastructure, gaining control of Euphrates river crossings, seizing highway interchanges along the 
Damascus-Baghdad corridor, and capturing rebel held fuel and ammunition depots in Deir ez-Zor. 

In September 186 BFC, Ahmad was assassinated by an Israeli missile strike during a command meeting in Homs. 
As Ahmad's designated second-in-command and the architect of the NRF's integration strategy, Al-Hashim assumed 
leadership with the unanimous support of the military council. He began systematically professionalizing former 
opposition fighters and marginalizing extremist factions by offering reconciliation to former government military 
officers. In March 185 BFC the NRF withdrew military forces from a demilitarised zone east of Golan and the Jordan 
river and agreed to Israeli staffed border crossings, in exchange for supervised access to Israel's Haifa port 
facilities for food shipments. During the resulting protests in Damascus NRF troops opened fire on protestors, killing 
at least 20.

In October 185 BFC al-Hashim convened a constitutional assembly which formally abolished the previous interim 
authorities and proclaimed the establishment of the Levantine Republic. After several months of lobbying by 
the TWF, Ankara recognized the newly formed republic after receiving guarantees on border security cooperation and 
containment of YPG forces. The republic's borders, ratified by the Damascus Accords of 184 BFC, did include two Kurdish
majority regions which in exchange for military co-operation received limited cantonal status with guaranteed 
representation.

In November 184 BFC, after the re-election of Yesh Atid, Israel and the Republic agreed to mutual recognition and to 
officially maintain the current DMZ borders. Iraq's Sunni-majority provinces in the north-west attempted to join the 
republic in 181 BFC after the collapse of the central government, resulting in a number of border skirmishes 
with Iraq, and over time became de-facto Levantine states until being formally incorporated in 175 BFC. The 
Alawite-majority coastal region between Latakia and Tartus remained an independent Russian supported statelet until 
being annexed by the Republic with the help of [[French~France]] special forces in 174 BFC during Russia's integration 
into the [[GPR]].

Al-Hashim established the government of the Republic as a unicameral Assembly elected indirectly by municipal councils, 
with candidate lists screened by an electoral board answerable to the presidency. He retained decree and veto powers, 
appointment of senior judges and governors, and command of the military and security services which he split into four 
independent establishments with senior staff drawn from by a mix of Sunnis, Kurds, Alawites, and Macronites; a structure 
which has been roughly retained for 200 years without a single coup. During the 180s and 170s he embarked on a number of 
ambitious infrastructure and public health projects, such as the Mediterranean solar powered desalination plants and 
pipelines, and nationalising [[Qalamoun Ḥayawiyya]] and using them to eradicate Cutaneous Leishmaniasis from the 
Republic.

Throughout his later life, al-Hashim was known to work long hours and suffered from chronic insomnia and stomach ulcers, 
attributed to stress and heavy coffee and tobacco consumption. In early 169 BFC, while inspecting the Aleppo–Raqqa 
canals, he collapsed and was airlifted to Damascus. Doctors stopped an esophageal vein bleed and fitted a smart shunt 
that auto-adjusted liver pressure via an internal sensor. Despite repeated medical interventions, refused to fully 
withdraw from state affairs and continued to hold cabinet sessions from his residence.

In late April 168 BFC he bled again despite the shunt and a liver-assist pack. Doctors gave him a one-shot antiviral,
but a bloodstream infection lead to liver and kidney failure. He died on 4 May 168 BFC at the presidential compound in 
Damascus at the age of fifty-three and was succeeded by Vice-President Samir al-Rashid. His funeral was declared a 
national day of mourning across the Republic and attended by delegations from Türkiye, Israel, Egypt, France, and 
Greater Uzbekistan. His body lay in state in the Assembly Hall before being interred two weeks later at the Martyrs’ 
Terrace overlooking the Euphrates at Deir ez-Zor, in a marble sarcophagus designed by the Ministry of Public Works.`,

    ['Ten-Hour War', {
        content: `The Ten-Hour War was a conflict between the [[United States]] and an alliance of the 
[[People's Republic of China (PRC)~China]], Russia, North Korea over positioning at the EM1 Lagrange Point. It began 
with [[InterMesh]] industrial sabotage, stepped up as a proxy conflict between [[Constellis Group]] and [[Dominio]] 
privateers, and culminated in the Battle of the Apex which was the first large scale space battle. It directly resulted 
in the formation of the [[GPR]] as a military and infomatic alliance, and to changes in fleet composition and doctrine.

In February 176, the United States began construction of Fort Liberty at EM1. A smaller non-military station had been 
built by the US in 179, and the PRC, with Russian assistance, had finished construction of their Tianmen station at EM1 
the next year. Fort Liberty was perceived by the PRC to be a great threat, due to its shipyard and long range missile
systems, and Dominio privateers were engaged to disrupt construction supplies being shipped from orbit. In response
the US heavily funded Constellis ship construction. By 174 BFC Constellis corvettes were escorting all supply ships and
had had a number of skirmishes with privateers. Both the US and PRC fleets remained in orbit or lunar transfers, as did 
the Constellis largest ship, the newly purchased CS Justice, of similar size to a [[second generation~Naval Rated Ship]] 
cruiser although lacking longer range missiles. North Korea did not have any non-orbital military space assets, but 
engaged in multiple remote sabotage attempts on US ground based and orbital construction facilities.

On the 19th March 176, with the station nearing completion, the US sent the frigate USS Unity on a Freedom of Navigation 
exercise to Fort Liberty. It refuelled at the station and was on its return on the 23rd March. At 16:30 that day the 
USNS Herrick came under fire from a privateer while delivering supplies. Its two Constellis escort corvettes CS Drake 
and CS Thor returned fire, crippling the ship, killing its crew, and making it the first ship destroyed in space 
combat. The Justice was already in a low-energy lunar transfer orbit and began a series of burns to join the Unity, 
which was adjusting its orbit to intercept Tianmen Station. Before they could join up the Unity was crippled by the 
Russian missile carrier MRK Mirazh and the commercial PRC [[drone~Drone]] cargo ship Tianzhou, leaving the Justice 
isolated and outnumbered with no nearby support and forcing it to use its remaining fuel to vector towards Earth.

During this time both the US second fleet and the PRC rapid response vessels had refuelled and moved out of their 
normal lunar orbits onto an approach with EM1. The US second fleet consisted of two frigates and seven corvette
escorts, and the PRC rapid response consisted of two frigates, six fast corvettes, and three Russian gunships. The US 
moved to DEFCON 2 and declared that EM1 was under blockade, but did not declare war. The bulk of the PRC and US fleets 
were stationed in Earth orbit, where both countries had a No First-Strike doctrine for orbital warfare due to the 
risk of creating a Kessler cascade. Both fleets dispatched task forces towards EM1, which was several days away from
Earth with fission thermal engines.

The Battle of the Apex occurred when the US second fleet engaged with the PRCs rapid response vessels, along with the
commercial PRC drone cargo ship Tianzhou and a Dominio privateer, in orbit around EM1. The initial missile salvos from 
both sides were were effectively countered by the opposing drone screens, allowing the fleets to close to drone range. 
The Russian gunships and the privateer were destroyed in the first pass by the US carrier launched chemical rocket 
powered suicide drones. The debris from the battle quickly cascaded and made orbital transfers risky, as well as greatly 
slowing down the EM1 three body intercept calculations. Both sides quickly exhausted their missiles followed by drones 
and maneuvering hydrogen, and being unable to afford the delta-V to return to drone range were forced to use their 
reserves to break off towards their respective stations.

At 02:30 on the 24th, 10 hours after the outbreak of hostilities, the PRC and US agreed to a truce at EM1. There were
a number of proxy conflicts in the next few days such as the conflict between the Mirazh and Justice, but none directly 
between the US and PRC. A total of 11 vessels were destroyed in the conflict, with 98 crew casualties. As a direct 
result of the conflict, the PRC, Russia, and North Korea created a mutual defense treaty stating that an attack on any 
member or their colony was a collective act of war against all, this treaty was the basis of the subsequent GPR 
alliance. Both the GPR and the US made a number of changes to their fleets, most notably increasing the number of supply 
vessels and smaller high maneuver ships transported into battle by large heavy burning carriers. Doctrine also changed 
to emphasise laying down and screening a much greater density of fuel depots (eventually leading to the development of
[[Fuel Pathing]], and using point defense lasers to clear debris. The effectiveness of swarms of attack and screening 
drones was well understood before the war, but both sides launched new fast high density drone carrier variants after 
it and started developing other [[Naval Auxiliary]] vessels.`,

need to protect high volume of inter-bloc trade, especially through the free trade zone in Azerbaijan, has motivated 
peaceful resolutions to most conflicts between the two Muslim power blocs.`,

    ['United States', {
content: `The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country 
primarily located in North America. Prior to the [[Khan Solar Storm]] it had overtaken the People's Republic of China
as the world's largest economy, and it still possesses the largest military and largest amount of wealth of any country, 
as well as being the largest contributor to and most influential member of the [[Peacekeepers]]. 

The collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the USAs growing domestic economic power in the years prior to the storm
had lead to the USAs increasing isolation, but it was a prosperous and optimistic period for the USA and those close 
allies which were still able to access its markets. The USA has always nominally been a constitutional oligarchic 
liberal democracy, however the shock of the storm resulted in a shift of its governing principles from E pluribus unum 
to what several historians have described as Res Publica Corporis Minimalis, the minimum required to secure the affairs 
of its corporations, which in return acted as proxies to secure US interests in external and domestic conflicts.

The storm began a nearly two century long period of isolation and abdication of many public affairs to corporations, 
for exxample many military assets were rented out to private defense contractors such as the [[Havfélög]]. A 
notable exception was a much closer integration with the remaining independent Canadian provinces as well as [[Gran 
México]] and the [[Mazatlán Zona Franca]] in the first years after the storm, due to a rapid increase in on-shoring 
supply chains. This then resulted in much closer political and terrestrial military co-operation as well as a lunar 
colony founded as a joint venture between several US and Mexican aerospace corporations. Throughout this period the US 
also maintained close ties to its traditional allies Great Britain, Australia, Israel, and the Philippines; and largely 
as a result they have remained non-aligned with any of the large confederations outside of the Peacekeepers (however 
Gran México, Mazatlán Zona Franca, and the Philippines have close ties to Roman Catholic [[Dominio]]). Although 
becoming more involved in system wide affairs through the Peacekeepers in in the last century BFC, the US government has 
only recently emerged as an active international political force in its own right after the [[First Contact Event]].`,

    ['X Group', {
content: `The X Group is a multiplanetary energy and industrial conglomerate headquartered in [[Hellas Planitia]], 
Mars. It was formed out of SpaceX and X-Power by X Musk after the death of his father Elon Musk, the eccentric 
trillionaire who founded and maintained control of both companies until his death. Their highest revenue product lines 
are spacecraft and satellite manufacture and launch services; off world power and water supply services; and navigation, 
propulsion management, and e-commerce [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]].

Global energy supply was the first of the ten-trillion dollar markets on Earth. The company Tesla was an automobile 
and energy company controlled by Elon Musk, and their Tesla Energy division owned the IP for a very high conversion 
efficiency rectenna. At the same time SpaceX controlled the majority of the world's launch, communications satellite, 
and in-orbit assembly markets. Their in-orbit assembly required giant space based solar power plants, and SpaceX had 
many manufacturing plants that were able to produce ground based antenna for their telecommunications business, 
Starlink. They were thus able to quickly scale up manufacture of rectenna to assist in post [[Khan~Khan Solar Storm]] 
recovery, and the economies of scale from combining their orbital and ground based assembly businesses soon allowed 
them to supply base load power at comparable cost to fission based nuclear power. 

X-Power was made an independent company in 172 BFC, although it continued to work in tandem with SpaceX on many projects 
such as laser ship pushing. In 135 BFC they partnered with [[Ångström]] to develop [[MarsNet]], and in 132 moved their 
headquarters to Starbase, Hellas Planitia. In 129 BFC they bought out China Minmetal's lunar silicon mines and Maxeon 
Solar Technologies to becoming the largest vertically integrated off earth photovoltaic supplier.

Due to intense competition from [[Semiotican]] in the orbital manufacturing market of the 100 BFCs, X Musk re-integrated 
X-Power into the greater X Group in order to extract greater efficiencies from the business. Notably their 
[[Fusion Power]] division both mines the Helium-3 and Deuterium and operates many power plants.`,
