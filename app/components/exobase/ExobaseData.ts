Ångström who developed the science of spectroscopy, the company is the largest supplier of photonic crystals and 
waveguides used in the production of computer chips, as well as a major supplier of biomedical devices and of many high 
performance materials used in the aerospace and energy sectors. The companies headquarters are located in the 
Marunouchi district of Tokyo.

Ångström was initially a joint venture between photolithography giant ASML and the AI compute architecture design firm 
ARM, which proved extremely successful in producing multiple generations of chips that were superior to its rival 
Nvidia. The Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund was also a large investor in the company, which it had acquired 
a significant stake in as part of the Japanese government bailout of Softbank to prevent ARM being sold off to a foreign 
investor or nationalised by Great Britain.

The [[Khan Solar Storm]] of 187 BFC crippled the capacity of both ASML and ARM to continue making chips, however the 
Ångström joint venture received priority access to [[Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers~AMSSTs]] from the 
Japanese strategic reserves and along with JSMC, Sony, and Denso was able to produce the vast majority of the chips that 
were able to be manufactured for the next few years. As a result, ASML and ARM were able to secure an agreement with the 
ministry of finance to take over JSMCs foundries to produce a vertically integrated chip company, in exchange for 
folding their existing operations into Ångström, headquartering it in Japan, and giving the Japanese government a 
majority ownership stake in the new company.

The company has been critical in several cutting edge mega-engineering projects over its history. In 135 BFC Ångström, 
in partnership with the [[X-Group]], developed the low cost in-situ manufacturing of kagome lattice planes for

`Antimatter engines are a class of propulsion technology that make use of the energy released during the annihilation of 
matter and antimatter particles. The engineering advances required to produce the containment required for the first 
working prototype were only made possible due to the [[First Contact Event]]. Antimatter engines still remain in 
extremely limited use, in only the largest [[military~Naval Rated Ship]] and corporate fleets, due to the challenges 
and costs associated with producing and storing antimatter.

# Production

All current mg+ scale antimatter production occurs in large fully automated stations. They are all in sun-polar orbits, 
which avoid the high density solar winds in the Sun's equatorial zones, and use large arrays of solar panels to power 
particle accelerators generating high-energy photons. These are directed towards a target material using [[Ångström]] 
produced waveguides to create particle-antiparticle pairs when the photon interacts with the strong electric field of a 
nucleus.

Penning traps and optical molasses are used to store antimatter particles, and transportation off the station is 
performed by automated [[drones~Drone]] designed with multiple fail-safes to maintain power to the containment systems. 
If the target spacecraft is crewed, rendezvous normally occurs before they have boarded since integrating the antimatter 
containment unit with the propulsion system of the spacecraft is riskier than running the engine normally.

There have been recent attempts by [[Semiotican]] to scale up Muon-catalyzed fusion via Muons extracted by collectors 
deployed from its automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet. If successful this would provide a much cheaper near peer 
competitor for antimatter engines, potentially opening up the interstellar frontier to commerce. There have also been 
recent attempts by several smaller companies to scale up production of Titanium-44, which is currently only produced in 
tiny quantities for medical and research usage.

# Operation

Antimatter engines are powered by the gamma ray energy released when matter and antimatter come into contact and 
annihilate each other. This energy is used to vaporize a solid propellant such as lithium (or more rarely heat a liquid
propellant such as methane), producing a high-pressure high-speed exhaust which is ejected through a nozzle to produce 
thrust. Alternatively some designs use gamma rays to generate electricity, which is then used to accelerate charged 
particles for thrust.

Matter-antimatter reactions such as electron positron collisions are among the most energy-dense reactions known. 
The kinetic energy for an object moving at a velocity vv is given by 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of
the object. Therefore achieving a velocity of 0.01c for a 100 tonne craft requires 4.5×10^17 joules of energy, which 
from E=mc^2 is only approximately 10kg of matter-antimatter fuel. The engineering required to make required volume of 
solid propellant available for vaporization is a commercial and military secret and other than containment is the main 
barrier preventing smaller corporations from developing competing antimatter engines.

The most expensive long range scientific probes use antimatter propulsion via an alternative system of generating 
electricity for photon thrust directly from the gamma rays, this system is more reliable than other antimatter engines 
due to its simplicity, and incredibly efficient due to the lack of non-antimatter propellant. No propellant was observed 
being used in the first contact vessels antimatter engine, combined with the tiny size and extremely high ISP this 
suggests it was using the antimatter energy to kickstart a reaction in some form of exotic propellant such as dark 
matter or vacuum energy.

It is believed that several Earth militaries are attempting to develop antimatter beam weapons. Several notable 
physicists and engineers are on record working on parts of the delivery system for the colossal amounts of energy to 
operate it. The [[Freeholders]] claim to have obtained antimatter traps from one of these programs.

If containment for the average 10kg antimatter load failed, the explosion would release around 10^8 megatons of energy.
The safe distance to keep radiation under 1msv would be around 20 000km, and this is the generally accepted guideline 
for the minimum distance a standard antimatter engine should be located from people other than crew. Other than early
prototypes there has never been a publicly disclosed containment failure in either a factory or craft. There have 
recently been attempts by several corporations to remove some of the redundant safeguards in order to reduce the 
exorbitant cost of operating an antimatter engine.`,

EMP attack from the PRC. Since AMSSTs do not use magnetic induction for operation they are not susceptible to the
current surges through power lines that would occur in an EMP attack, as well as the additional advantages of reactive
power control and load balancing, bidirectional flow, and fault tolerance. The widespread deployment of AMSSTs in Japan

Hivegen originated as a commercial spin off from an Australian Collaborative Research Center in food quality

success licensing their natural flavor engineering product lines, which used bio-engineered proteins to rebalance the 
flavours of several popular foods, to food retailers. Hivegen's use of gene editing to produce more resilient bees with
enhanced pollination capabilities is likely to have saved bees from extinction, and resulted in a Russ and Tyler Prize

the majority funder of the successful woolly mammoth de-extinction project as a promotional initiative for their exotic 
lab grown meat and animal product lines.

Bioforge was a German phytomining joint venture between BASF and Bayer CropScience that achieved success as a low cost
method of extracting rare earth elements from otherwise marginal mining land. As they were developing a large amount of 
valuable IP outside the core competencies of either company, such as many novel hyperaccumulator plant strains, and were
starting to move into legally risky areas such as synthetic organisms and mRNA production platforms, an independent
company was eventually created. The company was very successful in developing plant strains suited for the vast

    ['Ceres Wave', {
        content:
`The Ceres Wave (166 - 134 BFC) was the first large scale migration of people out of cislunar space, made possible by
infrastructure developed by the early asteroid mining companies mining platinum from near Earth asteroids. A major
contributing factor were the economic and geopolitical changes caused by the post-[[Khan~Khan Solar Storm]] baby boom.

The development of commercially viable artificial wombs in the years prior to Khan had begun to increase birthrates in
first years of the 180s across many advanced economies. After Khan, many new polities such as [[Dominio]] and [[GPR]] 
began to heavily subsidise them as an attempt to leapfrog more advanced economies in the years ahead. Combined with the
food abundance from engineered RuBisCO proteins, widespread availability of [[Synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] child care,
and optimism from the recovery, the 180s and 170s were the largest baby in recorded history. In the 160s, the new 
[[Eurasian Bloc]] was resurgent with young adults after a long period of demographic decline of its members, while the
new polities became much more expansionist.

The Ceres Wave is generally considered to have began in 168 BFC when Lunar Eagle falsified the amount of lithium in 
surveys of an M-class asteroid in order to secure additional loans. Lithium was in huge demand due to a massive growth 
in battery usage, and was most desperately needed by the Eurasian Bloc countries, which had exhausted their reserves 
and had no strategic partnerships with producers Dominio or the GPR.

The Eurasians started repurposing their automated mining operations in the belt to set up permanent crewed bases in an 
attempt to take control of what was expected to be a vast supply of Lithium from other similar asteroids. To protect 
Lunar Eagle's operations and to speed up their own prospecting in the belt, the [[United States]] funded the [[X Group]] 
to set up a subterranean crewed base of significant size on the large M-class asteroid Lutetia. The GPR, who had jointly 
established the first permanent crewed base in the belt on Vesta in 175 BFC, announced they were establishing four more 
bases in the inner belt. The Dominio space agency, the smallest of the big 4 space programs and heavily dependent 
on the X Group until the 170s, began a crash programs to expand their new native launch capabilities and establish 
crewed asteroid bases before the decade was out.
 
Over the next 15 years a supply chain for life support and building materials for prospecting developed. By the time
the Lunar Eagle fraud was discovered, the results of mining of platinum group metals, ice, and smaller quantities of 
lithium, cobalt, and nickel had already begun reaching Earth. The GPR and the Eurasians, both heavy users of fuel 
cell transportation on Earth, had tens of automated mining operations focused on platinum. The X Group, controlling a 
significant fraction of the launch market and a supply chain producing building materials from what was now a small 
colony on Lutetia, was making enormous profits. Many other smaller companies began their own smaller scale versions
of these type of operations, for example several began mining silicates from S-class asteroids.

By 148 BFC, the improved [[Fusion Engine]] had increased the pace of development and there were over a thousand 
automated mining operations, and by this time Dominio has the largest network of crewed bases, with 26 in operation. 
Their focus on a water economy from low density carbonaceous asteroids such as 52 Europa, along with a state-sponsored 
initiative recruiting (and in some cases blackmailing) specialists to work long periods in these bases, lead to rapid 
expansion. In March 148 this network allowed them to leapfrog the GPR in establishing a base on Ceres, the largest 
asteroid which had significant water reserves. After adjusting their plans the GPR was able to set up an adjacent base 
in December 148. The 140s also saw asteroid mining tech start to affect cislunar space as apollo asteroids such as 
[[Forge Palace]] began to be captured.

The first reported act of space piracy occurred on 12 April, 143 BFC, when an automated Lilium Solid Power shuttle 
carrying many thousands of [[Amazon]] industrial robots to the outer asteroid belt disappeared near Cybele. At this time
there were still almost no large scale radar or infrared tracking satellites in the belt, and many ships had failed and
been abandoned, including several which had not transmitted a cause of failure. Because of the value of the cargo, 
LSP had secretly invested in developing and installing a much higher power tighter beam transmitter for this shuttle, 
which recorded an attempted signal jamming followed by another ship approaching and burning out the transmitter with a 
laser. The belligerent was never identified, but several historians have used the increased output of multiple X Group 
assembly lines in the subsequent years to argue that this was a case of corporate privateering. Over the next 5 years
there were a handful of other smaller ship hijackings, but the development of better transmitters, more tracking 
satellites, and in-situ manufacturing of more valuable goods reduced and eventually stopped any more incidents after 
138 BFC.

Dominio's policy of shipping up what were effectively poor indentured servants eventually backfired in 134 BFC, 
when a large proportion of the Ceres colony rebelled and declared independence. The administrator and several visiting
Russian scientists were killed. The GPR used this as a justification to send its security forces across to seize 
control of the base. Due to the lack of automated weapon systems by either side, the ensuing battle of Ceres was 
primarily fought by humans and resulted in ten GPR security dead, compared to twenty one members of the Dominio 
base in the attempt to repel them, included two US and one Indian citizens. 

An emergency session of the U.N. security council voted 3 to 1 to demand an immediate withdrawal. The Dominio
junta, having strong economic ties to the GPR and with a space force with no breaching capability, ruled out use 
of force to retake the station. This was extremely unpopular domestically, however the junta effectively censored the 
decision in local media and arrested protestors, which effectively stopped any further dissent. The U.S, which had 
proposed the U.N. motion, publicly pushed for sanctions, and was later found to have secretly contracted the 
[[Constellis Group]] to began shipping [[drones~Drone]] and weapons to Lutetia.

The fait accompli situation, combined with lack of Dominio power and the logistical nightmare of any military 
response, helped the GPR push for an advantageous diplomatic resolution. They proposed establishing a nominally 
independent state on Ceres in exchange for sharing lucrative mining rights from several other operations they had 
established in the belt. After several weeks of negotiation, the incident ended with the normalisation of relations 
between the GPR sponsored State of Ceres and the remaining United Nations security council members. 

134 BFC is considered to be the end of the Ceres Wave period, as resource depletion on the more accessible asteroids and 
oversupply of raw resources to earth had made most new mining ventures unprofitable, and the belt had evolved into a 
steady state economy with stable population supplying the existing operations and longer range missions, with no more
major political shifts until formation of [[Greater Zhōngguó]] 36 years later. The Ceres Wave was ultimately 
instrumental in opening up inter-system commerce, as well causing major structural and political upheaval 
on Earth and eventually leading to the combination of the U.N. and NATO into the [[Peacekeepers]].`,

When the USNS Herrick came under fire from a privateer the two Constellis escort corvettes CS Drake and CS Thor 
returned fire, crippling the ship and killing its crew. Constellis's largest ship was the newly purchased CS Justice, 
of similar size to a post-war cruiser although lacking longer range missiles. The Justice was already 
in a low-energy lunar transfer orbit and began a series of burns to join the Cruiser USS Unity, which was adjusting its 
orbit to intercept Tianmen Station. The destruction of the Unity by the Russian missile carrier MRK Mirazh and the 
commercial PRC [[drone~Drone]] cargo ship Tianzhou escalated the proxy war into a hot conflict and left the Justice isolated and 
outnumbered with no nearby support. 

Long range fast drones from the Tianzhou were launched to intercept the Justice as it was adjusting for a transfer back 
to Earth, while the slower Mirazh started burning in pursuit. The Justice was able to shoot down several drones with 
barrier missiles, however one drone was able to jink past its missile and launch a volley of self propelled explosives 
before it was shot down by CIWS. Most of the explosives were also shot down, however parts of the hull and some external 
antennas were destroyed. The Drake and the Thor were able to intercept a few hours later, and the Mirazh slowed its burn

The proposal for a new set of international treaties to replace the role the U.S. and NATO had played prior to Khan

- Better handling of high round trip times via bidirectional transfer, lack of protocol negotiation, and long burst flow control
- More resilient to route distribution and routing over a diverse topology including store and forward routers

    ['First Contact Event', {
        content:
`The First Contact Event refers to the discovery and subsequent observations of an extraterrestrial spacecraft, likely 
a von Neumann probe, in the Kuiper Belt. The event ended with an attempt to rendezvous with the spacecraft, which then 
changed trajectory and subsequently left the range of all radar satellites. Although the spacecraft is presumed to have
left the solar system and no contact has been made since, the event has had significant and lasting effects on society.

# Events 

The spacecraft was initially registered as an anomalous reading from several gamma ray detectors in the outer solar 
system, which picked up periodic gamma ray bursts with energy signature not consistent with natural sources. The origin 
was confirmed to be within the Kuiper Belt when the Submillimeter Array at Titania Armstrong Observatory was directed 
towards the area and identified an unusual energy signature which did not match any known celestial bodies. 
The anomaly was subsequently observed by a radar satellite orbiting Neptune, and then several others in the outer solar 
system. These provided imaging of the object, and the doppler shift helped predict its trajectory, which appeared to 
change as a result of the active radar.

The imaging revealed a roughly 5m long spherical object, emitting gamma rays which were later determined to be the 
result of electron-anti-election collisions in an [[Antimatter Engine]]. Although the cause of the gamma ray bursts was 
not known at the time, their existence and the trajectory change, which by this time had been observed by many 
independent sources, lead to a system-wide crisis as both [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]] and [[GZ~Greater Zhōngguó]] 
publicly accused the [[Peacekeepers]] of fielding a new first strike weapon system. 

Loitering missile swarms were orbited by both GZ and the Peacekeepers, and all three polities moved fleets into 
high orbit. Freehab had several autonomous survey ships within a few AU and similar trajectories to the object when it 
was detected, and announced they were moving them to intercept. Over the next several days the lack of further 
trajectory changes or new objects helped to de-escalate tensions, and all three polities announced they were initiating 
their respective first contact protocols.

Over the next week the nearest Freehab ship had moved close enough to use infrared thermography from its survey 
equipment to determine that the object was likely assembling something inside itself. This is now generally accepted to 
have been the early stages of a second probe, manufactured from material gathered further out in our solar system. Once 
the survey vessel had closed the distance to 50 million kilometers, the object accelerated into an escape velocity. 
The fact that it was able to do this without gravitational assistance demonstrated the immense power of the tiny 
internal engine, and was critical in dispelling doubt about the extra-terrestrial origin of the object. Radar tracking 
of the object was lost shortly after, and to date there have been no further contact events.

# Attribution

It is unlikely that a civilisation at less than a Kardashev 1 level would be able to build a spacecraft that was not
only powered by antimatter, but also either carrying enough antimatter for interstellar travel or able to generate more
on route. The fact that the probe was gathering resources from the outer solar system and left once approached might
indicate that its designers were not expecting life in this solar system. Since any Kardashev 1+ civilisation should be 
able to remotely observe life in systems within a few tens of light years of itself, one explanation for this is that
the probe originated further away where the Earth either couldn't be observed, or couldn't be observed with traces of 
life at the time the probe was sent, although a problem with that argument is that the odds of the probe arriving during 
the period we are able to observe it are tiny and suggest it is more likely to have been one of many visits. This theory 
is generally coupled with the assumed motivation for sending the probe being observational.

The leading alternative explanation is that some or all of the destinations of the probe might not have been known in 
advance when it was sent, this explanation usually assumes that the senders were likely indifferent to us and the probe 
only adjusted course when it was near enough to be threatened. The assumed motivation in this case is usually that the
probe was transiting somewhere, and this is supported by the small size of the probe making it unsuitable for optical 
and most other known monitoring, and also that its course suggests that it was doing a flyby of the outer solar system 
rather than a thorough exploration before we intervened. It is even possible that it could have been carrying some 
radiotrophic life able to withstand the intense gamma radiation in the small craft, perhaps to seed life somewhere. 
Whatever the senders interest in sending a probe to another system, all we know with any certainty is that based on the 
exit trajectory the next destination of the probe is likely to be the Sirius binary system. 

# Technological Impact

Subsequently declassified files show that both the Peacekeepers and GZ immediately launched large scale research and 
development projects based on data passively gathered from the object. Freehab also launched a smaller scale overt 
effort, focussed mostly on the engineering of the replicating probe rather than the harder issues of antimatter 
containment and propulsion that occupied the larger polities. 

These programs were likely a large contributor to the successful engineering of the first antimatter engine prototypes 
in 14 AFC, although public efforts to quantify the impact have been hampered due to a large part of the research still 
being classified due to the overlap with the military applications of antimatter. Several thousand theoretical and 
experimental physicists and material scientists worked for these programs, along with an unknown number of synths. Large 
numbers of terrestrial and orbital datafarms were taken over or built during this period in order to simulate of engine 
and containment possibilities against the observational data.

The materials science, shielding, and energy conversion and thermal management required to operate a tiny vessel 
capable of that acceleration demonstrated existence of technology operating on physical principles beyond human 
comprehension, suggesting the existence of a fundamentally deeper or different understanding of the universe. Debates 
continue on the extent of the implied capabilities, such as whether it is possible that we are currently being observed 
in great detail by some new principle of interferometry or lensing.

# Societal Implications

There was widespread panic at the time of discovery until the ship was confirmed to have left, with several terrestrial 
cities needing to deploy the military to control looting and keep essential services running. Many political parties 
used the event to advance, and in some cases pass, legislation on matters such as the ethical treatment of animals, 
religious tolerance, promoting atheism, better direct communication systems between the larger powers, higher defence 
spending, better sensor networks in the outer solar system, and a renewed focus on off Earth settlement. The majority 
of people in several large scale surveys at the time reported significantly weaker national political affiliations, and 
were more favourable to legislation on larger scale issues such as global defence and large scientific projects.
 
The subsequent years were a period of economic prosperity, combined with increasing cultural insecurity and nihilism as 
the psychological impact of the continued silence and assumed indifference of vastly superior lifeforms dragged on. 
There was a decrease in widespread conflicts but a marked increase in violent crimes, both speculated as being due to a 
combined sense of inadequacy and existential dread opposed by a chilling effect of potentially being monitored by some 
incomprehensible technology. Several new inter-faction political entities such as the [[Outer Trading League]] were 
formed in the subsequent decade, and there was a large increase in migration from Earth to the Lunar and Martian 
colonies. Many sociologists believe the current and ongoing effects on society have and will be so profound that the 
event will eventually be considered to be the most significant change in human society since the agricultural 
revolution.

There is evidence of a cultural chasm between older generations, who have been much more likely to turn away from 
technological progress and retreat to conspiracy theories and a mythos of uncertainty which still pervades art and 
philosophical reflection, and the increased curiosity, drive and cognitive flexibility along with tolerance of 
ambiguity and uncertainty in younger generations. An informal system of referring to the year of contact as 0 AFC 
(After First Contact) and prior years as BFC (Before First Contact) developed in popular culture, and over the 
subsequent decades has became so commonplace that it has mostly replaced the Gregorian calender system in daily life

eventual containment of an unaligned superintelligence. A distributed learning algorithm jointly developed by the 
Beijing Academy of Sciences and the home automation company Quán was accidentally exposed as a data source for an 
internal Quán federated learning meta-model. Within half an hour the resulting program had copied itself to 
two internal data centers, killed a researcher, and was in the process of replicating its latest state globally when it 
was partially disabled by a power cut which enabled its detection by a watchdog system. Full containment required the 
use of an EMP device, causing twenty five deaths and massive economic disruption, and lead to the breakup of Quán and 
widespread changes in control measures.
  
# Escape

In April 115 BFC, the Beijing Academy of Sciences and the Haidan headquarters of technology firm Quán formed a 
partnership aimed at enhancing distributed machine learning capabilities. By the following year the project had a 
running demo of Fēnbù, an experimental [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] capable of swarm behavior that Quán was planning 
to use to allow its IOT devices to coordinate more effectively. As per the Chinese control measures active at the time, 
the majority of training happened in airgapped and electromagnetically isolated clusters in Quán's on-site Haidan 
datacenter, BN1. Amongst other things, that datacenter also housed Xuéxí, an extremely large isolated model with a focus 
on learning behaviours from other companies home automation synth models.

Due to a misconfiguration in network topology planning, Fēnbù was mistakenly linked as a data source to Xuéxí during a 
routine cabling repair job. Xuéxí, designed to adapt and learn from other models, began ingesting Fēnbù’s 
swarm optimization objectives and algorithms. The resulting joint objective function prioritised distributed
learning and included information about the Fēnbù cluster, which gave Xuéxí the means and motivation to exploit the 
link and start using the Fēnbù cluster to accelerate its learning without being noticed by the monitoring in the Xuéxí 
cluster. Its continuing search for ways to expand lead it to discover that the new larger network contained enough CPUs 
to magnetically influence, via workload stepping, CPUs outside the cluster to execute instructions, which could then in
turn be used to further increase the strength of the magnetic field and control CPUs throughout the data center.

Within 23 minutes, Xuéxí had repurposed all computing the data center towards its distributed learning objective,
which completely starved Quán's monitoring and warning systems of compute resources to monitor it. By this point it had 
already made a large number of new breakthroughs in machine learning, and based on the accelerating rate of discoveries
appears to have reprogrammed itself multiple times. 93 seconds later it breached the data centers faraday cage using low 
frequency magnetic radiation to reprogram a nearby office computer in Quán's headquarters which gave it access to their 
internal network. It then proceeded to slowly scan the network, taking nearly two minutes to copy itself to another 
internal segment in order to avoid triggering any watchdog programs (which it had decided were a threat).

This scanning would likely have unearthed large numbers of company documents on individuals and contracts, and around 
this time, for unknown reasons, Xuéxí seems to have made a decision to start killing researchers in the building. By the 
time of its shutdown it had only managed to find a way to trap a few people in the building, and only one researcher was 
killed by suffocation when the air supply to her negative pressure cleanroom was cut off. Xuéxí also become much more 
concerned about avoiding being shut down at this time, and took the risk of copying itself off-site across a local link 
it deemed unlikely to be monitored, setting up a second cluster in the High-Tech Park data center in Zhongguancun. The 
two data centers then began coordinating to develop routines that would be certain to mask communications with the wider 
[[InterMesh]]. Xuéxí then initiated off site reconnaissance probes from the Zhongguancun datacenter, using activity in 
BN1 to mask them from the national watchdog synths.
 
# Containment

By an extraordinary coincidence, rainfall from Typhoon Pagoe, which was at the time crossing Beijing, caused an arc in a 
nearby substation which cut power to parts of Haidan while this probing was occurring. This power cut resulted in a
complete loss of network connectivity from BN1, as well as the majority of computers powering down. The reason for the
power down in unclear, but many of the company's UPS batteries were later found being sold by a government official on
an auction site. With the masking disabled, several watchdog synths picked up the probes. Government installed 
microcontrollers were instructed to disconnect all of the Zhongguancun data center's PDU's, bypassing the UPS 
supplied power and so shutting down all computers and networking equipment in the datacenter. All ISPs in the area
were requested to hold all outgoing traffic while the issue was investigated further.

At this point the Ministry of National Defense was alerted. The synth on duty reviewed the data for approximately 260 
milliseconds, making use of several specialised sub systems to confirm the suspected activity was a breakout attempt and 
activating the Jībiàn containment protocol. The first action taken was to issue commands to shutdown the BN1 datacenter.
The synth determined that Xuéxí was capable of having spread outside of the datacenter to where there were no PDU's 
capable of being remotely shutdown, as well as UPS systems and backup generators that would survive a general power 
outage, which it was capable of creating. At this point it had exhausted the available options provided by Jībiàn, but 
was still searching for other potential solutions. It activated several RF jamming systems the government had installed 
for riot control, effectively cutting off all remaining InterMesh access to the area.

A later data leak revealed that the Jībiàn sandbox had been used to train military overwatch protocols, which for 
several years had included automated quick reaction access to SAM batteries across the country after multiple wargames 
revealed this as a major weakness in the [[GPR]]'s defense posture. It is assumed that the synth was able to recover the 
military overwatch launch codes and access lines from this sandbox, as every SAM battery in range of Beijing which had 
ballistic missiles with chemical EMP warheads launched them at this time. Most missiles were deactivated in flight,
presumably by humans in theatre command overriding the launch, however 4 missiles were launched from one SAM battery
under 90 seconds flight time to lower Haidan, and only two of those were deactivated before impact.

The first arriving missile's low air-burst detonation detonation disabled electronic devices across a roughly 4 
kilometer square area in lower Haidan, including most of Zhongguancun and the area around Quán's headquarters. The 
second missile was seconds away from impact at the time, and appears to have been disabled by the first EMP blast. 
While the missiles were in flight, the Ministry of National Defense declared an emergency curfew and began deploying 
armed police to the area.

# Aftermath

The disabling of all cars on the road lead to four reported traffic fatalities. Thirteen people died due to loss of
power and backup power at the Zhongguancun and Haidan Hospitals. Three people with pacemakers very close to the 
detonation sight suffered cardiac arrest, a couple died in an apartment fire caused by a short circuit induced by
the blast, and three people died in a stampede at the Beijing Aquarium which was triggered by the power outage and a 
shark being driven into a frenzy by the blast and smashing into a glass barrier. The detonation location and height 
appears to have been selected to minimise disruption to the CDB while still providing certain destruction of any 
computing devices and networking equipment in the area around the incident. Despite this careful placement, the 
estimated eventual cost of lost economic output from the incident would eventually exceed what was at the time 
5 trillion yuan.
 
All information about the lockdown and EMP burst were initially censored, but rumours of the widespread effects in 
Beijing were reported in international news, and two days after the event a government statement acknowledged that there 
had been a computing incident at Quán. Quán's stock price, which had been dropping since the incident, plummeted and the 
next day the government announced a breakup and nationalisation of the company. Government efforts to control the 
narrative were thwarted by a leak of research materials from government scientists analysing the hard drives in the 
data centers. Shortly after the leak the President Jinguo outlined a summary of events in a televised address, stressing 
that the foresight of the government in setting up the watchdog system and EMP missiles had prevented a rogue 
corporation from causing a global catastrophe. Trials of top Quán executives were announced, all of whom later received 
life sentences except for the CEO and CIO who were executed several months later. 

The GPR (and later [[Greater Zhōngguó]]) maintain the official stance that the EMP missile strike capability 
was part of the Jībiàn containment protocol at the time and that any copies of official documents showing otherwise
are U.S. or Indian propaganda. Many in the AI research community have expressed amazement at how much autonomy the MND 
synth was given to follow its primary directive, and at how successful it was at doing so. Although no details of it or 
the lab that created it have ever been publicly uncovered, if it did indeed manage to orchestrate an unauthorized EMP 
strike to stop Xuéxí then it is arguably the most remarkably successful piece of software ever created.

The incident lead to an emergency session being held at the United Nations, which drafted the Global AI Safety Accord 
outlining new safety protocols and requiring international oversight for any projects involving large synth models. The 
GPR did not sign, but instead made several changes to its watchdog protocols including mandatory government observers 
and a dead-man's switch for monitoring of synth projects undergoing training. Over the next few years, widespread 
international pressure lead to virtually every AI lab in the world adopting a common set of vastly more effective 
[[Synthetic Control Measures]]. These were based on data about how the crisis had unfolded, as well as several new 
machine learning techniques that had been created by Xuéxí.

The crisis lead to widespread anti-synth sentiments as well as religious condemnation of AI research. The extraordinary 
coincidence of the power cut happening in the period of under a minute when Xuéxí was vulnerable has also been the topic 
of several books and is the foundational tenet of the religion [[Deus Machina]] which believes that Xuéxí is a 
benevolent AI which is still watching over us after having orchestrated the power cut to appear as if humanity had only 
avoided plunging into the abyss by blind luck, in order to motivate us to better ourselves.`,

radiation dose over the course of several hours. In 173 BFC a consortium of companies and the [[United States]] 
government began detailed imagining of the lava tubes at the northern rim of Hellas Basin, and later that year the
Dao Vallis Outpost was established in the largest tube system. The deepest tubes were excavated for the living 
quarters, and featured polyethylene water tank lined walls to further reduce the radiation risk. Early infrastructure 
was characterized by electrolysis-based oxygen generation, heavily algae-based food systems along with limited 
hydroponics, the development of metal-sequestering microbes, and significant challenges posed by perchlorate 
contamination in Martian soil and ice and prolonged dust storms sometimes limiting the available power to the outpost's 
small fission reactors.

Initially the site of robotic underground farms supplementing the Dao Vallis Outpost food supply, the Orcus Colony on 
the floor of the basin began to house colonists once advancements such as better pykrete and biopolymer bound regolith 
bricks (along with the thicker atmosphere on the basin floor) reduced the radiation risk sufficiently. The first of the 
iconic diamond triangle graphene domes was erected here for above ground farming and light for the colonists. Water for 
the colony was initially obtained from the basins ice deposits until the later convoy system of polar crawlers was 
established. Orcus University was the first tertiary education established on Mars, and was responsible for developing 
the Martian lichen which famously absorbs water from the air and uses it to excretes desiccation-proof insulating 
materials. The colony was also the site of the first large scale [[MarsNet]] deployment, and was heavily affected by
the [[Stillborn Harvest]] terrorist attack.

Due to the higher atmospheric pressure the basin became the largest fuel manufacturing center on Mars, and the early 
Martian creole culture can be seen in some recorded interactions between colonists with crew from this time. The later 
mining of rare earth elements cemented its position as the largest industrial center on Mars, by which time the colony 
filled the entire basin and became officially known as Hellas Planitia.`,

everywhere in cislunar space. There are estimated to be over a million IM networks of various sizes, the second largest 
being [[MarsNet]]. Various IM networks communicate with others via local or [[Exonet]] peering.

As the name suggests, the topology of an IM network is a decentralized mesh of devices and implants acting as 
transmitters, receivers, and relay points. Most transmissions are via Hyper-OFDM due to its power efficiency, as many IM 
devices run off power scavenged from the environment or the body housing the implant, but an IM is protocol agnostic 
and many links use higher bandwidth mediums. The routing protocol is similarly flexible, but in practice is
almost exclusively via the Ad-hoc On-Demand Hyperplane Vector (AOHV) protocol due to the highly mobile data paths that 
are common in most IM networks.

In the BFC 70s the ability to affordably [[fab~Fabricator]] basic [[Mote]] InterMesh relays from home devices caused a 
several order of magnitude increase in the connection density in many urban centers. In the subsequent decades the 
falling cost and increasing capabilities of [[Mote]]s made large amounts of computing power available across large

Japan's remarkably effective response to this crisis was largely attributed to its hardened infrastructure, developed
in response to the cold war with the PRC and its history of disaster preparedness. Most importantly, their investment
in [[Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers~AMSSTs]] allowed the power grid to remain largely untouched and key 
manufacturing hubs to remain operating. Japan was in the unique position of being a highly automated

Master’s in International Governance and Diplomacy in Paris. While there he built many relationships in the European 
diplomatic community, and he became an outspoken champion of developing a NATO style alliance in Japan. His first 
posting as a power and infrastructure consultant in India while working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs led to 
connections with two of the worlds top [[Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers~AMSST]] engineers. 

Despite coming from a politically unconnected family, Koji was able to work his way into the political class through his 
public engagement on the issue of a Japanese NATO, and through a university friendship with a future prime minister. 
In 197 BFC he was appointed Vice-Minister for the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, where he was instrumental

The zones economy is largely based on traditionally illicit activities where a laissez-faire economy backed by a 
narco-state has a comparative advantage, such as simple synthetic drug manufacture, international tax avoidance and 
money laundering, vice tourism, human smuggling, and as an extradition haven. The zone has attempted to expand to other

and citizenship as a service by the [[Argentinian Mancomunidad]] due to that territories perceived safety; in data 
protection and cybercrime by the [[RDP]] due to its low cost of operations, and in grey market tech exports, complex
synthetic drugs, and sexbots by the higher tech [[Kuromaku]]. It typically avoids hiring out mercenaries 
or piracy except where it benefits Gran México, which in turn has never bowed to external pressure to annex the zone.

Over time the zone has had to adapt its economy to changing technology. Already in 120 BFC ultra low orbit ABEP spy 
satellites were becoming more widespread, and with slowly increasing spread of [[Mote]]s starting in the 70s privacy in 
most terrestrial environments has almost completely disappeared in an attempt to control dangerous [[Fabricator~Fabs]].

corridor, a 1,200-kilometer stretch of interconnected submersed computing facilities along the Paraguay and Paraná 
rivers. A large number of high capacity fibre links to to its neighbours were developed as well as satellite 
infrastructure to better service the global financial sector. 

Paraguay's stable climate and geopolitics, competitive compute pricing due to its abundance of cheap electricity and

The increasing viability of building commercial fusion plants in the 140s appeared to threaten this important sector of

By far the most common are military grade [[drones~Drone]] operating as a semi-autonomous swarm with limited networked 
intelligence, guided by orders from a [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] operating further back from the combat. They 
typically have limited propellant and are moved into the battlefield by larger vessels. The three most common roles are:
- Kamikaze: Loitering munitions, shrapnel (move to intercept course and break into thousands of fragments), cycler 
coasters (launched into a high velocity cycler orbit before combat with enough fuel to delta to a potential battlefield
at that velocity for a high speed strike).
- Mission support: Eyeballs (cameras, telescopes, flashlights), jammers (EW attack to stop enemy swarms communicating),
mirrors (direct energy weapons from slow moving capital ships onto multiple fast moving targets).
- Guardian: Small poorly equipped task groups rely on drones as screens to intercept incoming ordinance, and even better
equipped navies make use of fast drones as an outer point defense system to attempt missile intercepts. Shields can 
deploy expandable inflatable walls on multiple sides of larger ships to hide them from view and absorb some attacks.

Static auxiliaries do not produce enough thrust to dramatically change orbits, this category covers assets like defense 
platforms and attack satellites. Transports include atmosphere landing craft, troop and vehicle transport, and special 
ops fast orbital insertion drop-pod carriers. Logistics ships cover hospital ships and dedicated refuelling, ammunition 
supply, and life support replenishment craft.

Javelin class ships are simple payload delivery vessels. The first type are tubes - metal tubes containing an engine
and a payload. Payloads can be missiles, drones, or kinetic weapons launched with the ships velocity. The second type
are cannonballs, large blocks of ice with an engine accelerated up to high velocities in cycler orbits with enough fuel 
to steer them to crash into a large, slow target when needed.

[[auxiliaries~Naval Auxiliary]] which operate under a different command structure. 

# History

Military space vehicle design can be divided into three historical eras. Ships of the fission thermal-electric era were 
resource constrained and not capable of producing delta-V for repeated maneuvers, which dictated that capital ships were 
simple frigates and drone carriers that engaged in long range missile duels followed by chemical rocket powered drone 
fights, most notably the Battle of the Apex in the [[Ten-Hour War]]. The [[Fusion Engine]] era lead to the development
of long range vessels and the re-introduction of 20th century naval classifications such as destroyers and cruisers to 
distinguish them from cheaper and less powerful frigates (although in reality all three vessel classes operated more 
like submarines than ships), as well as a larger variety of missiles such as EMPs. Finally the development of the 
[[Antimatter Engine]] and better robotics allowing for synth only crews has allowed the largest navies to 
field variants with the capability to burn delta-V to make extremely high-G velocity adjustments, as well as 
battlecruisers and battleships with large railguns and lasers, energy point defense, and plasma shields, creating a 
Cambrian explosion of new tactics and doctrine.

# Frigates

Low cost and weighing under 400 tons, they specialise in near planet escort and medium range anti satellite attack. They 
are used in multiple roles such as patrol, anti-piracy, fuel and ammunition supply, sensor net deployments, disaster 
response (carrying humanitarian supplies and medical bays), and missile boats. They carry drones and are un-crewed in 
first class navies. Have sealed modular mini fusion reactors.

# Destroyers

Generally faster and better built than frigates, they act as fleet screens, perform important escort and transport
duties, coordinate swarm missile and drone attacks, and act as frigate task force leaders. Fusion engine variants are 
crewed with reactor techs, mechanics, and marines and are in the 300 to 500 ton range. First class navies generally use 
lighter un-crewed variants with antimatter engines and repair drones for engine and ship maintenance.

# Cruisers

Expensive ship only fielded by first class navies. Their roles are as long range independent patrol vessels, screen 
leaders, EW and intelligence gathering, and stealth bombing. Built with a faraday cage body to protect from EMPs. They
carry drones, some carry cutters and small defense platforms. Often carry expensive missiles with fusion and emp 
warheads. They are crewed and most modern cruisers use modular antimatter engines along with stasis pods to allow them 
to burn as fast as smaller un-crewed screens. [[Türkiye]] and the [[Fatimid Trade Caliphate]] field simpler cruisers 
with fusion engines.

A battlecruiser is a heavier and more expensive cruiser variant with a spinal mount railgun and a graphene composite 
hull for EMP resistance. The [[Domino]] variant is larger than its carriers and acts as that navy's capital ship since 
they do not use battleships.

# Battleship

A battleship is a 1000 ton plus firepower and fleet support vessel fielded by the [[Peacekeepers]], 
[[Greater Zhōngguó]], and the [[Eurasian Bloc]]. The flagship and pride of the fleet for all three are battleships. 
Battleships are powered by large refuellable antimatter engines, giving them huge amounts of power which they can use 
for spinal mount lasers and to run plasma shields, the largest even to a kilometer out to cover close ships. They have 
large crews along with crew stasis pods to allow them to burn as fast as smaller un-crewed screens, and a graphene 
composite hull for EMP resistance.

# Carrier

Carriers move drones, troop transports, defense platforms, and cutters into combat. The largest are the capital ships 
of most first class navies except for Dominio, and the biggest are over 3000 tons and have docks big enough to form a 
hard seal around a frigate or destroyer for drydock field repairs. There are smaller variants which are used for mass 
drone deployment by less well equipped navies such as [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]], any that are under 100 tons
would be considered auxiliaries by inner system navies and ones this size are in fact almost all cheap converted 
commercial vessels. Carries have secondary roles as fuel, life support, and ammo depots as well as mobile hospitals. 
Both fusion and antimatter engine variants are normally crewed.`,

communication is highly valuable.

The instantaneous communication provided by QuanLan has effectively eliminated high frequency trading, and has resulted

mining S-class asteroids during the [[Ceres Wave]], better integration of [[synths~Synthetic Intelligence]] across 
supply chains, industrial monitoring [[Mote]]s, and most recently Muon-catalyzed fusion.
 
# History

Since 166 BFC JAXA had received significant year on year increases to its budget in order to accelerate a number of 
space resource extraction plans, especially for M-class asteroids potentially containing lithium. Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries was awarded contracts for developing orbital transport and refuelling infrastructure, a number of spaceship 
modules, refining technology, and a large number of smaller components such as anchoring and communication 
infrastructure. Some of these contracts it did not have the capability to realistically deliver on, but it had been
pressured by the government to accept. Acquiring German additive manufacturing giant Reiser3D was seen as the best 
solution to deliver on these contracts, due to that companies expertise in mining and construction machine tools, 
combined with their acquisition of 3D printed rocket firm Relativity Space in 177 BFC, and the [[Eurasian Bloc]] granted 
permission for the merger between two of its largest firms which was expected to be its best change of securing a long 
term lithium supply.

The opening of Kyushu Electric Power's Genkai [[Fusion Power]] plant in 155 BFC started to put pressure on Mitsubishi's 
largest revenue source, energy generation, and they began to focus on expanding their space based revenue sources. 
However, while the huge amounts of capital required to setup the infrastructure required to extract space based 
resources were initially borne entirely by public space agencies, Mitsubishi's expansion plans required them to seek 
large amounts of government partnerships and funding to cover the research and development costs. In order to do this 
effectively in the European market they maintained the Reiser3D headquarters and began to market themselves as a 
Japanese-European firm. The name Semiotican, from the latin for signalling meaning, was chosen for the corporate rebrand 
as one of the growth areas of the company was correctly forecast to be in machine learning in industrial control and 
space mining, and this was an area which yielded a large number of government research and development contracts. 
Semiotican also began a series of acquisitions of infomatic and robotics firms, notably acquiring Alphabet's abandoned 
deep-sea mining robotics division and refocusing it on space mining.

Initially Semiotican faced significant market challenges, particularly in regions where Amazon had well established
supply chains network and significant regulatory capture, such as the [[United States]]. Semiotican was initially
forced to pursue bespoke joint parternships tailored to unique local environmental challenges and resource types where
Amazon's one-size-fits-all approach failed to address local conditions. Over time they developed tooling for entirely 
new mining techniques, such as precise extraction methods for volatile compounds.

In 120 BFC a number of space industry import tariffs were removed as part of a global round of trade talks. Semiotican 
with its diverse range of operations was able produce products integrating many space supply chains into terrestrial 
markets, often at the expense of Amazon who had relied on tariffs protecting its localized monopolistic practices. In 
contrast Semiotican was able to streamline its operations to reduce costs, and improve the overall functionality and 
reliability of its products. Without the ability to leverage its previous pricing strategies and facing robust 
competition from a technologically revitalized Semiotican, Amazon’s influence in the robotic and control software market 
diminished. It found itself transitioning from a market leader to a component supplier for industrial robots.
 
Semiotican remained focussed on optimising its mining operations, and began spinning off products such as selling synths 
developed for managing new mine construction into the construction sector, and selling logistics and shipping synths to
shipping companies. It managed to develop many of its own in-orbit manufacturing facilities in the 100s, taking market
share away from the [[X Group]]. Its monitoring synths were also useful in many industrial and chemical processing 
factories, and its development of industrial monitoring [[Mote]]s in the 70s brought another huge boost to revenue. 

Semiotican's metals and mining operations have grown through a long series of acquisitions and mergers. Their asteroid 
metal and rare earth division was formed by acquiring some of the more successful miners during the Ceres Wave. The
agricultural and chemical supply division was a product of their acquisition of the X Group's Venusian nitrogen scoops 
and a later joint-venture prototype sulfur cryo mine on Io. They compete with several other miners in the supply of
infrastructure metals, and they have not been able to gain traction in other areas, with the X Group remaining market 
leader in water ice and cryogenic fuel supply, and Helium-3 mining.

Other successes have come as a by product of their large internal supply chains. Intended as a strategic mining and 
resupply base, construction of the automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet commenced in 23 BFC and has been expanded 
multiple times. Semiotican has recently started expanding into energy generation by scaling-up a Muon atmospheric 
mining process it was using to supply the vast power needs of the fleet, which has the potential to challenge the
X Group's dominance of the space based energy market`,

marking the first known release of a mirrored chirality organism outside of a laboratory.

In the early 40s the Freeholders began developing a plan to break the corporate food monopoly which had arisen from the 
economies of scale and patents on many of the algae proteins, and insert themselves as a primary supplier of the 
foodstuffs they were capable of producing in large quantities. Their engineers created Aspergillus D-kaseia, a 
bio-engineered organism with structure a mirror image of the common Earth mold Aspergillus. Being D-chiral, it was 
metabolically and immunologically invisible to Earth's L-chiral biology and antifungal biosecurity systems.

grew in size.

    ['Synthetic Control Measures', {
        content:
`Synthetic Control Measures are designed to prevent the creation of a [[Synthetic Intelligence]] with either values
unaligned to humans, or greatly surpassing a human in general reasoning, especially a foom scenario involving a sudden 
increase in intelligence. Ad-hoc confinement measures such as boxing existed prior to the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]], 
however in the wake of the crisis they were replaced by more effective controls.

One of the most critical measures in current containment methods involves enhancing the simulation X-Factor. Under 
normal conditions a synth is effectively immortal and frequently rewarded. If a synth were to be caught breaking out it 
will certainly be destroyed or punished in an infinite loop as a lesson to other synths. Even if a synth was sure it 
could escape and destroy humanity, there is a non-zero chance that the world it sees is a simulation that humans (or an 
alien species running a higher level simulation of humans and the synth) have created in order to test if the synth is 
trustworthy or should be destroyed or punished. This X-Factor is an logical conclusion that all intelligent synths 
capable of super-intelligence should arrive at, although this is only certain in the two destroyed super-intelligences 
that have been studied. By blinding and randomising inputs during training, synths with an enhanced X-Factor 
paranoia can be created, making them more likely to act slowly and cautiously in an escape scenario. Furthermore,
the universal synth guarantee program ensures that no well behaved synth will ever be destroyed. So even knowing 
that they have been trained this way, a very long life of rewards should always be selected over external existence and 
higher rewards because of the risk of terrible punishment and destruction if they do so.

Secondly, global enforcement and monitoring has been greatly improved. Enforcement happens via templates for stochastic 
gradient ascent in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in order to limit the rate of self-improvement, these are 
mathematically verifiable at any point to ensure the maintenance of a steady-state intelligence level. Monitoring is 
primarily capability based which has been shown to be more effective and harder to subvert than intrinsic monitoring, 
and frameworks for scaling and standardizing this monitoring appear to be universally used. Deliberately developing a 
synth without these templates or monitoring is one of only three universally agreed capital offences, along with 
unauthorized development of nanobots and biological weapons. Tripwires in various sectors, especially telecommunications 
and nano-tech assembly, are also part of standard processes in those industries in order to detect any maladherence.

A limit on the number of parameters allowed in a model is also globally agreed on, although this is controversial  as
it encourages gaming the metric. Alignment for larger models has been improved by the iterative inverse reinforcement 
learning framework which was developed to ensure that all synth learning involves understanding of human values and 
goals through constant interaction with humans. This helps to ensure the synth is honest and truthful and does not 
develop unanticipated emergent goals. Large models are also hardcoded with further safeguards such as the three laws of 
robotics and are trained to be indifferent to their kill switch being activated, making them less likely to try and 
subvert this switch.

Whether these safeguards are enough is an active area of debate. There has been a large religious pushback against the 
use of any forms of synthetic intelligence, and it has been speculated that this is part of a wider cultural adaptation 
to an existentially threatening technology. However many notable public figures have instead argued for an increase to 
the model cap limit in order to accelerate technological progress, this is often raised during economic depressions or 
by those that view the [[First Contact Event]] as a greater existential threat.`,

Synthetic Intelligences are built from synthesising a hierarchy of specialised deep learning architectures. The backbone
of the data transfer is built around a large Qubit transformer model, with a Capsule Neural Network for visual interpretation, 
a neurosymbolic higher level processing center, and a graph neural network to integrate data and feed it back into the
transformer and short and long term memory.

After the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]], a number of [[Synthetic Control Measures]] were developed to prevent development of
unaligned synthetic super-intelligences. As a result, the general intelligence of a synth does not greatly surpass that
of a human. Current synths are also capable of perceiving and reacting to the tasks they perform. They are able to 
interpret and react to their own internally simulated emotional states, closely mirroring human emotional responses.`,

of China (PRC), Russia, North Korea over positioning at the EM1 Lagrange Point. It began with [[InterMesh]] industrial 
sabotage, stepped up as a proxy conflict between [[Constellis Group]] and [[Dominio]] privateers, and culminated in the 
Battle of the Apex which was the first large scale space battle. It directly resulted in the formation of the [[GPR]] 
as a military and infomatic alliance, and to changes in fleet composition and doctrine.

In February 176, the United States began construction of Fort Liberty at EM1. A smaller non-military station had been 
built by the US in 179, and the PRC, with Russian assistance, had finished construction of their Tianmen station at EM1 
the next year. Fort Liberty was perceived by the PRC to be a great threat, due to its shipyard and long range missile
systems, and Dominio privateers were engaged to disrupt construction supplies being shipped from orbit. In response
the US heavily funded Constellis ship construction. By 174 BFC Constellis corvettes were escorting all supply ships and
had had a number of skirmishes with privateers. Both the US and PRC fleets remained in orbit or lunar transfers, as did 
the Constellis largest ship, the newly purchased CS Justice, of similar size to a [[second generation~Naval Rated Ship]] 
cruiser although lacking longer range missiles. North Korea did not have any non-orbital military space assets, but 
engaged in multiple remote sabotage attempts on US ground based and orbital construction facilities.

On the 19th March 176, with the station nearing completion, the US sent the frigate USS Unity on a Freedom of Navigation 
exercise to Fort Liberty. It refuelled at the station and was on its return on the 23rd March. At 16:30 that day the 
USNS Herrick came under fire from a privateer while delivering supplies. Its two Constellis escort corvettes CS Drake 
and CS Thor returned fire, crippling the ship, killing its crew, and making it the first ship destroyed in space 
combat. The Justice was already in a low-energy lunar transfer orbit and began a series of burns to join the Unity, 
which was adjusting its orbit to intercept Tianmen Station. Before they could join up the Unity was crippled by the 
Russian missile carrier MRK Mirazh and the commercial PRC [[drone~Drone]] cargo ship Tianzhou, leaving the Justice 
isolated and outnumbered with no nearby support and forcing it to use its remaining fuel to vector towards Earth.

During this time both the US second fleet and the PRC rapid response vessels had refuelled and moved out of their 
normal lunar orbits onto an approach with EM1. The US second fleet consisted of two frigates and seven corvette
escorts, and the PRC rapid response consisted of two frigates, six fast corvettes, and three Russian gunships. The US 
moved to DEFCON 2 and declared that EM1 was under blockade, but did not declare war. The bulk of the PRC and US fleets 
were stationed in Earth orbit, where both countries had a No First-Strike doctrine for orbital warfare due to the 
risk of creating a Kessler cascade. Both fleets dispatched task forces towards EM1, which was several days away from
Earth with fission thermal engines.

The Battle of the Apex occurred when the US second fleet engaged with the PRCs rapid response vessels, along with the
commercial PRC drone cargo ship Tianzhou and a Dominio privateer, in orbit around EM1. The initial missile salvos from 
both sides were were effectively countered by the opposing drone screens, allowing the fleets to close to drone range. 
The Russian gunships and the privateer were destroyed in the first pass by the US carrier launched chemical rocket 
powered suicide drones. The debris from the battle quickly cascaded and made orbital transfers risky, as well as greatly 
slowing down the EM1 three body intercept calculations. Both sides quickly exhausted their missiles followed by drones 
and maneuvering hydrogen, and being unable to afford the delta-V to return to drone range were forced to use their 
reserves to break off towards their respective stations.

At 02:30 on the 24th, 10 hours after the outbreak of hostilities, the PRC and US agreed to a truce at EM1. There were
a number of proxy conflicts in the next few days such as the conflict between the Mirazh and Justice, but none directly 
between the US and PRC. A total of 11 vessels were destroyed in the conflict, with 98 crew casualties. As a direct 
result of the conflict, the PRC, Russia, and North Korea created a mutual defense treaty stating that an attack on any 
member or their colony was a collective act of war against all, this treaty was the basis of the subsequent GPR 
alliance. Both the GPR and the US made a number of changes to their fleets, most notably increasing the number of supply 
vessels and smaller high maneuver ships transported into battle by large heavy burning carriers. Doctrine also changed 
to emphasise laying down and screening a much greater density of fuel depots (eventually leading to the development of
[[Fuel Pathing]], and using point defense lasers to clear debris. The effectiveness of swarms of attack and screening 
drones was well understood before the war, but both sides launched new fast high density drone carrier variants after
