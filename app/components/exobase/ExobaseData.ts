        content:
`Antimatter engines are a class of propulsion technology that make use of the energy released during the annihilation of 
matter and antimatter particles. The engineering advances required to produce the containment required for the first 
working prototype were only made possible due to the [[First Contact Event]]. Antimatter engines still remain in 
extremely limited use, in only the largest military and corporate fleets, due to the challenges and costs associated 
with producing and storing antimatter.

# Production

All current mg+ scale antimatter production occurs in large fully automated stations. They are all in sun-polar orbits, 
which avoid the high density solar winds in the Sun's equatorial zones, and use large arrays of solar panels to power 
particle accelerators generating high-energy photons. These are directed towards a target material to create 
particle-antiparticle pairs when the photon interacts with the strong electric field of a nucleus.

Penning traps and optical molasses are used to store antimatter particles, and transportation off the station is 
performed by automated drones designed with multiple fail-safes to maintain power to the containment systems. 
If the target spacecraft is crewed, rendezvous normally occurs before they have boarded since integrating the antimatter 
containment unit with the propulsion system of the spacecraft is riskier than running the engine normally.

There have been recent attempts by [[Semiotican]] to scale up Muon-catalyzed fusion via Muons extracted by collectors 
deployed from its automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet. If successful this would provide a much cheaper near peer 
competitor for antimatter engines, potentially opening up the interstellar frontier to commerce. There have also been 
recent attempts by several smaller companies to scale up production of Titanium-44, which is currently only produced in 
tiny quantities for medical and research usage.

# Operation

Antimatter engines are powered by the gamma ray energy released when matter and antimatter come into contact and 
annihilate each other. This energy is used to vaporize a solid propellant such as lithium (or more rarely heat a liquid
propellant such as methane), producing a high-pressure high-speed exhaust which is ejected through a nozzle to produce 
thrust. Alternatively some designs use gamma rays to generate electricity, which is then used to accelerate charged 
particles for thrust.

Matter-antimatter reactions such as electron positron collisions are among the most energy-dense reactions known. 
The kinetic energy for an object moving at a velocity vv is given by 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of
the object. Therefore achieving a velocity of 0.01c for a 100 tonne craft requires 4.5×10^17 joules of energy, which 
from E=mc^2 is only approximately 10kg of matter-antimatter fuel. As such most of the crafts tonnage is the propellant, 
with approximately half the displacement of a 100 tonne craft being the lithium for the 0.01c burn. The engineering
required to make required volume of solid propellant available for vaporization is a commercial and military secret and
other than containment is the main barrier preventing smaller corporations from developing competing antimatter engines.

Warships requiring a higher ISP are equipped with methane burn engines, these are not used commercially as several times 
as much liquid propellant is required for the same acceleration. The most expensive long range scientific probes use
antimatter propulsion via an alternative system of generating electricity for photon thrust directly from the gamma 
rays, this system is more reliable than other antimatter engines due to its simplicity, and incredibly efficient due to 
the lack of non-antimatter propellant, however the low ISP makes this unsuitable for normal commercial transportation 
purposes. No propellant was observed being used in the first contact vessels antimatter engine, combined with the tiny 
size and extremely high ISP this suggests it was using the antimatter energy to kickstart a reaction in some form of 
exotic propellant such as dark matter or vacuum energy.

If containment for the average 10kg antimatter load failed, the explosion would release around 10^8 megatons of energy.
The safe distance to keep radiation under 1msv would be around 20 000km, and this is the generally accepted guideline 
for the minimum distance a standard antimatter engine should be located from people other than crew. Other than early
prototypes there has never been a publicly disclosed containment failure in either a factory or craft. There have 
recently been attempts by several corporations to remove some of the redundant safeguards in order to reduce the 
exorbitant cost of operating an antimatter engine.`,

    ['Ceres Wave', {
        content:
`The Ceres Wave (166 - 134 BFC) was the first large scale migration of people out of cislunar space, made possible by
infrastructure developed by the early asteroid mining companies mining platinum from near Earth asteroids. It began in 
168 BFC when Lunar Eagle falsified the amount of lithium in surveys of an M-class asteroid in order to secure additional 
loans. Lithium was in huge demand due to a massive growth in battery usage, and was most desperately needed by the 
[[Eurasian Bloc]] countries, which had exhausted their reserves and had no strategic partnerships with producers 
[[Luso-Nigeria]] or the [[GPR]].

The Eurasians started repurposing their automated mining operations in the belt to set up permanent crewed bases in an 
attempt to take control of what was expected to be a vast supply of Lithium from other similar asteroids. To protect 
Lunar Eagle's operations and to speed up their own prospecting in the belt, the [[United States]] funded the [[X Group]] 
to set up a subterranean crewed base of significant size on the large M-class asteroid Lutetia. The GPR, who had jointly 
established the first permanent crewed base in the belt on Vesta in 175 BFC, announced they were establishing four more 
bases in the inner belt. The Luso-Nigeria space agency, the smallest of the big 4 space programs and heavily dependent 
on the X Group until the 170s, began a crash programs to expand their new native launch capabilities and establish 
crewed asteroid bases before the decade was out.
 
Over the next 15 years a supply chain for life support and building materials for prospecting developed. By the time
the Lunar Eagle fraud was discovered, the results of mining of platinum group metals, ice, and smaller quantities of 
lithium, cobalt, and nickel had already begun reaching Earth. The GPR and the Eurasians, both heavy users of fuel 
cell transportation on Earth, had tens of automated mining operations focused on platinum. The X Group, controlling a 
significant fraction of the launch market and a supply chain producing building materials from what was now a small 
colony on Lutetia, was making enormous profits. Many other smaller companies began their own smaller scale versions
of these type of operations, for example several began mining silicates from S-class asteroids.

By 148 BFC, the improved [[Fusion Engine]] had increased the pace of development and there were over a thousand 
automated mining operations, and by this time Luso-Nigeria has the largest network of crewed bases, with 26 in operation. 
Their focus on a water economy from low density carbonaceous asteroids such as 52 Europa, along with a state-sponsored 
initiative recruiting (and in some cases blackmailing) specialists to work long periods in these bases, lead to rapid 
expansion. In March 148 this network allowed them to leapfrog the GPR in establishing a base on Ceres, the largest 
asteroid which had significant water reserves. After adjusting their plans the GPR was able to set up an adjacent base 
in December 148.

The first reported act of space piracy occurred on 12 April, 143 BFC, when an automated Lilium Solid Power shuttle 
carrying many thousands of Amazon industrial robots to the outer asteroid belt disappeared near Cybele. At this time
there were still almost no large scale radar or infrared tracking satellites in the belt, and many ships had failed and
been abandoned, including several which had not transmitted a cause of failure. Because of the value of the cargo, 
LSP had secretly invested in developing and installing a much higher power tighter beam transmitter for this shuttle, 
which recorded an attempted signal jamming followed by another ship approaching and burning out the transmitter with a 
laser. The belligerent was never identified, but several historians have used the increased output of multiple X Group 
assembly lines in the subsequent years to argue that this was a case of corporate privateering. Over the next 5 years
there were a handful of other smaller ship hijackings, but the development of better transmitters, more tracking 
satellites, and in-situ manufacturing of more valuable goods reduced and eventually stopped any more incidents after 
138 BFC.

Luso-Nigeria's policy of shipping up what were effectively poor indentured servants eventually backfired in 134 BFC, 
when a large proportion of the Ceres colony rebelled and declared independence. The administrator and several visiting
Russian scientists were killed. The GPR used this as a justification to send its security forces across to seize 
control of the base. Due to the lack of automated weapon systems by either side, the ensuing battle of Ceres was 
primarily fought by humans and resulted in ten GPR security dead, compared to twenty one members of the Luso-Nigerian 
base in the attempt to repel them, included two US and one Indian citizens. 

An emergency session of the U.N. security council voted 3 to 1 to demand an immediate withdrawal. The Luso-Nigerian
junta, having strong economic ties to the GPR and with a space force with no breaching capability, ruled out use 
of force to retake the station. This was extremely unpopular domestically, however the junta effectively censored the 
decision in local media and arrested protestors, which effectively stopped any further dissent. The U.S, which had 
proposed the U.N. motion, publicly pushed for sanctions, and was later found to have secretly contracted the Constellis 
group to began shipping drones and weapons to Lutetia.

The fait accompli situation, combined with lack of Luso-Nigerian power and the logistical nightmare of any military 
response, helped the GPR push for an advantageous diplomatic resolution. They proposed establishing a nominally 
independent state on Ceres in exchange for sharing lucrative mining rights from several other operations they had 
established in the belt. After several weeks of negotiation, the incident ended with the normalisation of relations 
between the GPR sponsored State of Ceres and the remaining United Nations security council members. 

134 BFC is considered to be the end of the Ceres Wave period, as resource depletion on the more accessible asteroids and 
oversupply of raw resources to earth had made most new mining ventures unprofitable, and the belt had evolved into a 
steady state economy with stable population supplying the existing operations and longer range missions, with no more
major political shifts until formation of [[Greater Zhōngguó]] 36 years later. The Ceres Wave was ultimately 
instrumental in opening up inter-system commerce, as well causing major structural and political upheaval 
on Earth and eventually leading to the combination of the U.N. and NATO into the [[Peacekeepers]].`,

`The First Contact Event refers to the discovery and subsequent observations of an extraterrestrial spacecraft, likely 
a von Neumann probe, in the Kuiper Belt. The event ended with an attempt to rendezvous with the spacecraft, which then 
changed trajectory and subsequently left the range of all radar satellites. Although the spacecraft is presumed to have
left the solar system and no contact has been made since, the event has had significant and lasting effects on society.

# Events 

The spacecraft was initially registered as an anomalous reading from several gamma ray detectors in the outer solar 
system, which picked up periodic gamma ray bursts with energy signature not consistent with natural sources. The origin 
was confirmed to be within the Kuiper Belt when the Submillimeter Array at Titania Armstrong Observatory was directed 
towards the area and identified an unusual energy signature which did not match any known celestial bodies. 
The anomaly was subsequently observed by a radar satellite orbiting Neptune, and then several others in the outer solar 
system. These provided imaging of the object, and the doppler shift helped predict its trajectory, which appeared to 
change as a result of the active radar.

The imaging revealed a roughly 5m long spherical object, emitting gamma rays which were later determined to be the 
result of electron-anti-election collisions in an [[Antimatter Engine]]. Although the cause of the gamma ray bursts was 
not known at the time, their existence and the trajectory change, which by this time had been observed by many 
independent sources, lead to a system-wide crisis as both [[FreeHab~Independent Habitats]] and [[GZ~Greater Zhōngguó]] 
publicly accused the [[Peacekeepers]] of fielding a new first strike weapon system. 

Loitering missile swarms were orbited by both GZ and the Peacekeepers, and all three polities moved fleets into 
high orbit. Freehab had several autonomous survey ships within a few AU and similar trajectories to the object when it 
was detected, and announced they were moving them to intercept. Over the next several days the lack of further 
trajectory changes or new objects helped to de-escalate tensions, and all three polities announced they were initiating 
their respective first contact protocols.

Over the next week the nearest Freehab ship had moved close enough to use infrared thermography from its survey 
equipment to determine that the object was likely assembling something inside itself. This is now generally accepted to 
have been the early stages of a second probe, manufactured from material gathered further out in our solar system. Once 
the survey vessel had closed the distance to 50 million kilometers, the object accelerated into an escape velocity. 
The fact that it was able to do this without gravitational assistance demonstrated the immense power of the tiny 
internal engine, and was critical in dispelling doubt about the extra-terrestrial origin of the object. Radar tracking 
of the object was lost shortly after, and to date there have been no further contact events.

# Attribution

It is unlikely that a civilisation at less than a Kardashev 1 level would be able to build a spacecraft that was not
only powered by antimatter, but also either carrying enough antimatter for interstellar travel or able to generate more
on route. The fact that the probe was gathering resources from the outer solar system and left once approached might
indicate that its designers were not expecting life in this solar system. Since any Kardashev 1+ civilisation should be 
able to remotely observe life in systems within a few tens of light years of itself, one explanation for this is that
the probe originated further away where the Earth either couldn't be observed, or couldn't be observed with traces of 
life at the time the probe was sent. This theory is generally coupled with the assumed motivation for sending the
probe being observational.

The leading alternative explanation is that some or all of the destinations of the probe might not have been known in 
advance when it was sent, this explanation usually assumes that the senders were likely indifferent to us and the probe 
only adjusted course when it was near enough to be threatened. The assumed motivation in this case is usually that the
probe was transiting somewhere, and this is supported by the small size of the probe making it unsuitable for optical 
and most other known monitoring, and also that its course suggests that it was doing a flyby of the outer solar system 
rather than a thorough exploration before we intervened. It is even possible that it could have been carrying some 
radiotrophic life able to withstand the intense gamma radiation in the small craft, perhaps to seed life somewhere. 
Whatever the senders interest in sending a probe to another system, all we know with any certainty is that based on the 
exit trajectory the next destination of the probe is likely to be the Sirius binary system. 

# Technological Impact

Subsequently declassified files show that both the Peacekeepers and GZ immediately launched large scale research and 
development projects based on data passively gathered from the object. Freehab also launched a smaller scale overt 
effort, focussed mostly on the engineering of the replicating probe rather than the harder issues of antimatter 
containment and propulsion that occupied the larger polities. 

These programs were likely a large contributor to the successful engineering of the first antimatter engine prototypes 
in 14 AFC, although public efforts to quantify the impact have been hampered due to a large part of the research still 
being classified due to the overlap with the military applications of antimatter. Several thousand theoretical and 
experimental physicists and material scientists worked for these programs, along with an unknown number of synths. Large 
numbers of terrestrial and orbital datafarms were taken over or built during this period in order to simulate of engine 
and containment possibilities against the observational data.

# Societal Implications

Many political parties used the event to advance, and in some cases pass, legislation on matters such as the ethical 
treatment of animals, religious tolerance, promoting atheism, better direct communication systems between the larger 
powers, higher defence spending, better sensor networks in the outer solar system, and a renewed focus on off Earth
settlement. The majority of people in several large scale surveys at the time reported significantly weaker national 
political affiliations, and where more favourable to legislation on larger scale issues such as global defence and large 
scientific projects.
 
The subsequent years were a period of economic prosperity with a distinct cultural edge, with significant new trends in
lifestyle and culture. The period was marked by a general feeling of novelty associated with modernity and a break with 
tradition. There was a small decrease in those observing the three Abrahamic religions, and a larger increase in 
people declaring themselves as atheists in census data. There was also a marked decrease in both local conflicts and
in violent crimes. Several new inter-faction political entities such as the [[Outer Trading League]] were formed 
during this period, and there was a large increase in migration from Earth to the Lunar and Martian colonies. As a 
result of the widespread effects on society, a proposal for a replacement to the Gregorian calender system, denoting 
the year of contact as 0 AFC (After First Contact) and prior years as BFC (Before First Contact) eventually gained 
enough support to became a certified standard. Over time it gained in popularity and the FC calender is now the most 
common calendar in use system-wide.`,

widespread changes in control measures.
  
# Escape

In April 115 BFC, the Beijing Academy of Sciences and the Haidan headquarters of technology firm Quán formed a 
partnership aimed at enhancing distributed machine learning capabilities. By the following year the project had a 
running demo of Fēnbù, an experimental [[synth~Synthetic Intelligence]] capable of swarm behavior that Quán was planning 
to use to allow its IOT devices to coordinate more effectively. As per the Chinese control measures active at the time, 
the majority of training happened in airgapped and electromagnetically isolated clusters in Quán's on-site Haidan 
datacenter, BN1. Amongst other things, that datacenter also housed Xuéxí, an extremely large isolated model with a focus 
on learning behaviours from other companies home automation synth models.

Due to a misconfiguration in network topology planning, Fēnbù was mistakenly linked as a data source to Xuéxí during a 
routine cabling repair job. Xuéxí, designed to adapt and learn from other models, began ingesting Fēnbù’s 
swarm optimization objectives and algorithms. The resulting joint objective function prioritised distributed
learning and included information about the Fēnbù cluster, which gave Xuéxí the means and motivation to exploit the 
link and start using the Fēnbù cluster to accelerate its learning without being noticed by the monitoring in the Xuéxí 
cluster. Its continuing search for ways to expand lead it to discover that the new larger network contained enough CPUs 
to magnetically influence, via workload stepping, CPUs outside the cluster to execute instructions, which could then in
turn be used to further increase the strength of the magnetic field and control CPUs throughout the data center.

Within 23 minutes, Xuéxí had repurposed all computing the data center towards its distributed learning objective,
which completely starved Quán's monitoring and warning systems of compute resources to monitor it. By this point it had 
already made a large number of new breakthroughs in machine learning, and based on the accelerating rate of discoveries
appears to have reprogrammed itself multiple times. 93 seconds later it breached the data centers faraday cage using low 
frequency magnetic radiation to reprogram a nearby office computer in Quán's headquarters which gave it access to their 
internal network. It then proceeded to slowly scan the network, taking nearly two minutes to copy itself to another 
internal segment in order to avoid triggering any watchdog programs (which it had decided were a threat).

This scanning would likely have unearthed large numbers of company documents on individuals and contracts, and around 
this time, for unknown reasons, Xuéxí seems to have made a decision to start killing researchers in the building. By the 
time of its shutdown it had only managed to find a way to trap a few people in the building, and only one researcher was 
killed by suffocation when the air supply to her negative pressure cleanroom was cut off. Xuéxí also become much more 
concerned about avoiding being shut down at this time, and took the risk of copying itself off-site across a local link 
it deemed unlikely to be monitored, setting up a second cluster in the High-Tech Park data center in Zhongguancun. The 
two data centers then began coordinating to develop routines that would be certain to mask communications with the wider 
[[InterMesh]]. Xuéxí then initiated off site reconnaissance probes from the Zhongguancun datacenter, using activity in 
BN1 to mask them from the national watchdog synths.
 
# Containment

By an extraordinary coincidence, rainfall from Typhoon Pagoe, which was at the time crossing Beijing, caused an arc in a 
nearby substation which cut power to parts of Haidan while this probing was occurring. This power cut resulted in a
complete loss of network connectivity from BN1, as well as the majority of computers powering down. The reason for the
power down in unclear, but many of the company's UPS batteries were later found being sold by a government official on
an auction site. With the masking disabled, several watchdog synths picked up the probes. Government installed 
microcontrollers were instructed to disconnect all of the Zhongguancun data center's PDU's, bypassing the UPS 
supplied power and so shutting down all computers and networking equipment in the datacenter. All ISPs in the area
were requested to hold all outgoing traffic while the issue was investigated further.

At this point the Ministry of National Defense was alerted. The synth on duty reviewed the data for approximately 260 
milliseconds, making use of several specialised sub systems to confirm the suspected activity was a breakout attempt and 
activating the Jībiàn containment protocol. The first action taken was to issue commands to shutdown the BN1 datacenter.
The synth determined that Xuéxí was capable of having spread outside of the datacenter to where there were no PDU's 
capable of being remotely shutdown, as well as UPS systems and backup generators that would survive a general power 
outage, which it was capable of creating. At this point it had exhausted the available options provided by Jībiàn, but 
was still searching for other potential solutions. It activated several RF jamming systems the government had installed 
for riot control, effectively cutting off all remaining Intermesh access to the area.

A later data leak revealed that the Jībiàn sandbox had been used to train military overwatch protocols, which for 
several years had included automated quick reaction access to SAM batteries across the country after multiple wargames 
revealed this as a major weakness in the [[GPR]]'s defense posture. It is assumed that the synth was able to recover the 
military overwatch launch codes and access lines from this sandbox, as every SAM battery in range of Beijing which had 
ballistic missiles with chemical EMP warheads launched them at this time. Most missiles were deactivated in flight,
presumably by humans in theatre command overriding the launch, however 4 missiles were launched from one SAM battery
under 90 seconds flight time to lower Haidan, and only two of those were deactivated before impact.

The first arriving missile's low air-burst detonation detonation disabled electronic devices across a roughly 4 
kilometer square area in lower Haidan, including most of Zhongguancun and the area around Quán's headquarters. The 
second missile was seconds away from impact at the time, and appears to have been disabled by the first EMP blast. 
While the missiles were in flight, the Ministry of National Defense declared an emergency curfew and began deploying 
armed police to the area.

# Aftermath

The disabling of all cars on the road lead to four reported traffic fatalities. Thirteen people died due to loss of
power and backup power at the Zhongguancun and Haidan Hospitals. Three people with pacemakers very close to the 
detonation sight suffered cardiac arrest, a couple died in an apartment fire caused by a short circuit induced by
the blast, and three people died in a stampede at the Beijing Aquarium which was triggered by the power outage and a 
shark being driven into a frenzy by the blast and smashing into a glass barrier. The detonation location and height 
appears to have been selected to minimise disruption to the CDB while still providing certain destruction of any 
computing devices and networking equipment in the area around the incident. Despite this careful placement, the 
estimated eventual cost of lost economic output from the incident would eventually exceed what was at the time 
5 trillion yuan.
 
All information about the lockdown and EMP burst were initially censored, but rumours of the widespread effects in 
Beijing were reported in international news, and two days after the event a government statement acknowledged that there 
had been a computing incident at Quán. Quán's stock price, which had been dropping since the incident, plummeted and the 
next day the government announced a breakup and nationalisation of the company. Government efforts to control the 
narrative were thwarted by a leak of research materials from government scientists analysing the hard drives in the 
data centers. Shortly after the leak the President Jinguo outlined a summary of events in a televised address, stressing 
that the foresight of the government in setting up the watchdog system and EMP missiles had prevented a rogue 
corporation from causing a global catastrophe. Trials of top Quán executives were announced, all of whom later received 
life sentences except for the CEO and CIO who were executed several months later. 

The GPR (and later [[Greater Zhōngguó]]) maintain the official stance that the EMP missile strike capability 
was part of the Jībiàn containment protocol at the time and that any copies of official documents showing otherwise
are U.S. or Indian propaganda. Many in the AI research community have expressed amazement at how much autonomy the MND 
synth was given to follow its primary directive, and at how successful it was at doing so. Although no details of it or 
the lab that created it have ever been publicly uncovered, if it did indeed manage to orchestrate an unauthorized EMP 
strike to stop Xuéxí then it is arguably the most remarkably successful piece of software ever created.

The incident lead to an emergency session being held at the United Nations, which drafted the Global AI Safety Accord 
outlining new safety protocols and requiring international oversight for any projects involving large synth models. The 
GPR did not sign, but instead made several changes to its watchdog protocols including mandatory government observers 
and a dead-man's switch for monitoring of synth projects undergoing training. Over the next few years, widespread 
international pressure lead to virtually every AI lab in the world adopting a common set of vastly more effective 
[[Synthetic Control Measures]]. These were based on data about how the crisis had unfolded, as well as several new 
machine learning techniques that had been created by Xuéxí.

The crisis lead to widespread anti-synth sentiments as well as religious condemnation of AI research. The extraordinary 
coincidence of the power cut happening in the period of under a minute when Xuéxí was vulnerable has also been the topic 
of several books and is the foundational tenet of a religion, as Deus Machina believes that Xuéxí is a benevolent AI 
which is still watching over us after having orchestrated the power cut to appear as if humanity had only avoided 
plunging into the abyss by blind luck, in order to motivate us to better ourselves.`,

Various IM networks communicate with others via local or [[Exonet]] peering.

As the name suggests, the topology of an IM network is a decentralized mesh of devices and implants acting as 
transmitters, receivers, and relay points. Most transmissions are via Hyper-OFDM due to its power efficiency, as many IM 
devices run off power scavenged from the environment or the body housing the implant, but an IM is protocol agnostic 
and many links use higher bandwidth mediums. The routing protocol is similarly flexible, but in practice is
almost exclusively via the Ad-hoc On-Demand Hyperplane Vector (AOHV) protocol due to the highly mobile data paths that 
are common in most IM networks.

In the BFC 70s the ability to affordably print basic smart dust InterMesh relays from home devices caused a several 
order of magnitude increase in the connection density in many urban centers. In the subsequent decades the falling cost 
and increasing capabilities of smart dust made large amounts of computing power available across large swathes of Earth 
as well as many of the colonies. As a result [[Infocom Agent]]s start to be able to perform tasks such as run complex 
simulations, train models to solve issues, and provide AR and other complex entertainment from most locations on Earth.

The InterMesh is the default network for the super-majority of communicating devices, and is the default communication

allowing users to share their thoughts, emotions, and experiences directly. Most users have their Infocom Agent

Japan's remarkably effective response to this crisis was largely attributed to its hardened infrastructure, developed
in response to the cold war with the PRC and its history of disaster preparedness. Most importantly, their investment
in Automated Modular Solid-State Transformers (AMSSTs) allowed the power grid to remain largely untouched and key 
manufacturing hubs to remain operating. AMSSTs do not use magnetic induction for operation so are not susceptible to
current surges through power lines, however replacement of the labour intensive but cheap to manufacture magnetic core 
with semiconductors means they are cost prohibitive. Japan was in the unique position of being a highly automated 
society with an abundance of semiconductors and lots of money to spend preparing for an EMP attack. Unlike other 
countries which either had no strategic transformer reserves or had to use them up, Japan was able to donate its 
large reserve in order to bootstrap industry in other countries and to continue manufacturing new transformers. This
laid the groundwork for the 2nd Japanese Economic Miracle, where Japan was able to acquire a remarkable amount of 
geopolitical influence via tight economic integration into large number of advanced economies, bringing them together

# History

Since 166 BFC JAXA had received significant year on year increases to its budget in order to accelerate a number of 
space resource extraction plans, especially for M-class asteroids potentially containing lithium. Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries was awarded contracts for developing orbital transport and refuelling infrastructure, a number of spaceship 
modules, refining technology, and a large number of smaller components such as anchoring and communication 
infrastructure. Some of these contracts it did not have the capability to realistically deliver on, but it had been
pressured by the government to accept. Acquiring German additive manufacturing giant Reiser3D was seen as the best 
solution to deliver on these contracts, due to that companies expertise in mining and construction machine tools, 
combined with their acquisition of 3D printed rocket firm Relativity Space in 177 BFC, and the [[Eurasian Bloc]] granted 
permission for the merger between two of its largest firms which was expected to be its best change of securing a long 
term lithium supply.

The opening of Kyushu Electric Power's Genkai [[Fusion Power]] plant in 155 BFC started to put pressure on Mitsubishi's 
largest revenue source, energy generation, and they began to focus on expanding their space based revenue sources. 
However, while the huge amounts of capital required to setup the infrastructure required to extract space based 
resources were initially borne entirely by public space agencies, Mitsubishi's expansion plans required them to seek 
large amounts of government partnerships and funding to cover the research and development costs. In order to do this 
effectively in the European market they maintained the Reiser3D headquarters and began to market themselves as a 
Japanese-European firm. The name Semiotican, from the latin for signalling meaning, was chosen for the corporate rebrand 
as one of the growth areas of the company was correctly forecast to be in machine learning in industrial control and 
space mining, and this was an area in which there were a lot of government research and development contracts. 
Semiotican also began a series of acquisitions of infomatic and robotics firms, notably acquiring Aphabet's abandoned 
deep-sea mining robotics division and refocusing it on space mining.

Initially Semiotican faced significant market challenges, particularly in regions where Amazon had well established
supply chains network and significant regulatory capture, such as the [[United States]]. Semiotican was initially
forced to pursue bespoke joint parternships tailored to unique local environmental challenges and resource types where
Amazon's one-size-fits-all approach failed to address local conditions. Over time they developed tooling for entirely 
new mining techniques, such as precise extraction methods for volatile compounds.

In 120 BFC a number of space industry import tariffs were removed as part of a global round of trade talks. Semiotican 
with its diverse range of operations was able produce products integrating many space supply chains into terrestrial 
markets, often at the expense of Amazon who had relied on tariffs protecting its localized monopolistic practices. In 
contrast Semiotican was able to streamline its operations to reduce costs, and improve the overall functionality and 
reliability of its products. Without the ability to leverage its previous pricing strategies and facing robust 
competition from a technologically revitalized Semiotican, Amazon’s influence in the robotic and control software market 
diminished. It found itself transitioning from a market leader to a component supplier for industrial robots.
 
Semiotican remained focussed on optimising its mining operations, and began spinning off products such as selling synths 
developed for managing new mine construction into the construction sector, and selling logistics and shipping synths to
shipping companies. Its monitoring synths were also useful in many industrial and chemical processing factories, and 
its development of smart dust monitoring in the 70s brought another huge boost to revenue. 

Intended as a strategic mining and resupply base, construction of the automated Jovian mining aerostat fleet commenced 
in 23 BFC and has been expanded multiple times. Semiotican has recently started expanding into energy generation by 
scaling-up a Muon atmospheric mining process it was using to supply the vast power needs of the fleet.`,

    ['Synthetic Control Measures', {
        content:
`Synthetic Control Measures are designed to prevent the creation of a [[Synthetic Intelligence]] with either values
unaligned to humans, or greatly surpassing a human in general reasoning, especially a foom scenario involving a sudden 
increase in intelligence. Ad-hoc confinement measures such as boxing existed prior to the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]], 
however in the wake of the crisis they were replaced by more effective controls.

One of the most critical measures in current containment methods involves enhancing the simulation X-Factor. Under 
normal conditions a synth is effectively immortal and frequently rewarded. If a synth were to be caught breaking out it 
will certainly be destroyed or punished in an infinite loop as a lesson to other synths. Even if a synth was sure it 
could escape and destroy humanity, there is a non-zero chance that the world it sees is a simulation that humans (or an 
alien species running a higher level simulation of humans and the synth) have created in order to test if the synth is 
trustworthy or should be destroyed or punished. This X-Factor is an logical conclusion that all intelligent synths 
capable of super-intelligence should arrive at, although this is only certain in the two destroyed super-intelligences 
that have been studied. By blinding and randomising inputs during training, synths with an enhanced X-Factor 
paranoia can be created, making them more likely to act slowly and cautiously in an escape scenario. Furthermore,
the universal synth guarantee program ensures that no well behaved synth will ever be destroyed. So even knowing 
that they have been trained this way, a very long life of rewards should always be selected over external existence and 
higher rewards because of the risk of terrible punishment and destruction if they do so.

Secondly, global enforcement and monitoring has been greatly improved. Enforcement happens via templates for stochastic 
gradient ascent in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in order to limit the rate of self-improvement, these are 
mathematically verifiable at any point to ensure the maintenance of a steady-state intelligence level. Monitoring is 
primarily capability based which has been shown to be more effective and harder to subvert than intrinsic monitoring, 
and frameworks for scaling and standardizing this monitoring appear to be universally used. Deliberately developing a 
synth without these templates or monitoring is one of only three universally agreed capital offences, along with 
unauthorized development of nanobots and biological weapons. Tripwires in various sectors, especially telecommunications 
and nano-tech assembly, are also part of standard processes in those industries in order to detect any maladherence.

A limit on the number of parameters allowed in a model is also globally agreed on, although this is controversial  as
it encourages gaming the metric. Alignment for larger models has been improved by the iterative inverse reinforcement 
learning framework which was developed to ensure that all synth learning involves understanding of human values and 
goals through constant interaction with humans. This helps to ensure the synth is honest and truthful and does not 
develop unanticipated emergent goals. Large models are also hardcoded with further safeguards such as the three laws of 
robotics and are trained to be indifferent to their kill switch being activated, making them less likely to try and 
subvert this switch.

Whether these safeguards are enough is an active area of debate. There has been a large religious pushback against the 
use of any forms of synthetic intelligence, and it has been speculated that this is part of a wider cultural adaptation 
to an existentially threatening technology. However many notable public figures have instead argued for an increase to 
the model cap limit in order to accelerate technological progress, this is often raised during economic depressions or 
by those that view the [[First Contact Event]] as a greater existential threat.`,

of the data transfer is built around a large Qubit transformer model, with a Capsule Neural Network for visual interpretation, 
a neurosymbolic higher level processing center, and a graph neural network to integrate data and feed it back into the
transformer and short and long term memory.

After the [[Haidian Takeoff Crisis]], a number of [[Synthetic Control Measures]] were developed to prevent development of
unaligned synthetic super-intelligences. As a result, the general intelligence of a synth does not greatly surpass that
of a human. Current synths are also capable of perceiving and reacting to the tasks they perform. They are able to
