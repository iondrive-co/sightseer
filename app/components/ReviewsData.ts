        summary: `Like a sci-fi Mulholland Drive, this film's dreamy and hypnotic shots pack a much more powerful punch 
        than Solaris (or 2001 for that matter) and effectively bring the difficult cerebral concepts in Roadside Picnic 
        to life in a deeply visceral and intuitive way.`,
