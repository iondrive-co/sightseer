    ['Exobase',
`The Exobase is an [[Exonet]] hosted encyclopedic compendium, consisting of a small number of articles on notable 
locations, people, events, and technology. It is notable for having concise articles that gracefully degrade to 
holographic AR and even to text, and is often used at extremely high latency endpoints where [[QuanLan]] is unavailable 
or prohibitively expensive. It is also notable for not being community edited, and for its popularity despite its lack 
of citations[1] and having numerous factual inaccuracies which often remain uncorrected for extended periods of time.

In 2052 the first version of Exobase was conceived as a subset of the larger Exopedia project by a third generation 
generative AI which had been tasked with finding ways to distribute simple summaries of notable facts to the numerous 
migrants in the [[Ceres Wave]]. It was never widely used by its intended audience, but later became popular in certain 
communities such as the [[Retrograde Diaspora]] and over time has become one of the most widely consulted resources by 
[[personal infocom agents]] in the outer solar system.

During the [[Value Crisis]] the original AI author was decommissioned. Articles are still frequently added and updated, 
although the current author is unknown. One popular theory is that the Exobase is now maintained by a [[cognosym]] 
stuck in a mimetic feedback loop with itself.`],
    ['Exonet',
`The Exonet, commonly known as X.O.N. or The Zon, is the interplanetary system of interconnected [[InterMesh]] networks.

Its main distinguishing features compared to short range network systems are:
- A protocol stack layer dedicated to ultra high frequency phonon modulation compression and error correction
- Better handling of high round trip times via bidirectional transfer with lack of protocol negotiation
- More resilient to route distribution and routing over a diverse topology including store and forward routers
- CDN caching built into the application layer, allowing popular sites such as [[Exobase]] to be hosted locally
- Lack of many peer to peer and distributed ledger functions present in the InterMesh`],
