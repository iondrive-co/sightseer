                <p className="mb-4">I created this space in the original spirit of the world wide web, which was for me and many others
a hopeful and positive experience with a decentralized network of personal expression. Before LLMs were a thing, every
line of code, every design decision was a personal choice, and in a small way became a digital representation of the
creator. This collection of creative writing, opinions, projects, and links to the work of others, helps me recapture a
little of that magic. </p>

<p className="mb-4">This site lives on the edge â€” Cloudflare Pages - which is free and means faster response times
regardless of where you are in the world. It might surprise you to learn that this is a static site, in that it loads
everything from the server once. For example the entire exobase is just text, commited into github so I have a versioned
history of everything I write, which is automatically deployed via wrangler. I am not a web developer, but I have found
tailwind to be simple enough to use and create a layout which (mostly) adapts gracefully from phone to desktop. And I
do use LLMs for help with various technical issues, since after all I am only human.</p>
